In fantastic tales, the heroes and their foes both grow in power over the course of an adventure. But it isn\u2019t time alone that grows a hero\u2019s capabilities. Rather, it\u2019s the adrenaline that comes from battle, the danger of the hero\u2019s profession, and the pressure to save the world that pushes a character to do the impossible. Each small act of heroism gives a hero the confidence and bravery to perform legendary feats against all odds.</p> <p>The things a hero can achieve at the end of the story are far more daring and impactful than what they do at the start, and the final showdown against a villain\u2019s forces is more deadly and desperate than the first.

Ele acusou todos aqueles leais a sua m\u00e3e de trai\u00e7\u00e3o, e achou uma ocasi\u00e3o para emprisionar e executar todos sem julgamento. Sir Llewellyn serviu a Duquesa lealmente e esfor\u00e7ou-se para servir o novo Duque, mas penou para reconciliar seu senso de justi\u00e7a com a mal\u00edcia caprichosa do novo Duque.</p> <p>O novo Duque ansiava para emprisionar o cavaleiro favorito de sua m\u00e3e, mas todos os guardas, castel\u00f5es e o povo da cidade e vila admiravam Llewellyn. Melianus ent\u00e3o o enviava em uma s\u00e9rie de miss\u00f5es, uma mais mortal que a outra.</p> <p>Os Julgamentos de Llewellyn, como ficou conhecido, passaram a lenda e suas f\u00e1bulas ainda s\u00e3o contadas em Corwell. Llewellyn e o Drag\u00e3o de Sete Olhos, Llewellyn e a Bruxa do P\u00e2ntano, Llewellyn e a Torre de \u00d4nix.</p> <p>Quando Llewellyn abateu Ghruk a Trollhag ela gritou \"Siga Melianus!\" enquanto morria. Llewellyn achou que ela estava dizendo para ele obedec\u00ea-lo e ser leal a ele, mas enquanto ele cavalgava sua fiel corcel Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata de volta para o Castelo Gant, Llewellyn come\u00e7ou a suspeitar o que Ghruk quis dizer.</p> <p>Naquela noite, Llewellyn espera nos est\u00e1bulos e, \u00e0 meia-noite, Melianus aparece. Ele monta seu grande cavalo de guerra Fogo de Carv\u00e3o e sai cavalgando. Para onde, Llewellyn n\u00e3o tinha ideia. Mas o cavaleiro segue o duque enquanto ele cavalga para o leste em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao p\u00e2ntano, Llewellyn se lembra dos rumores.</p> <p>Na margem do p\u00e2ntano os olhos de Fogo de Carv\u00e3o come\u00e7am a brilhar com uma chama sinistra e sua crina irrompe em um fogo carmesim. Llewellyn perde o ar de seus pulm\u00f5es. \"Um pesadelo!\", ele percebe. Os rumores s\u00e3o verdadeiros! O feiticeiro deu a Melianus um corcel demon\u00edaco.</p> <p>Nos cascos flamejantes do pesadelo Melianus consegue atravessar o loda\u00e7al intransit\u00e1vel. Llewellyn recua, nenhum homem poderia atravessar esse brejo amaldi\u00e7oado. Mas Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata d\u00e1 uma trotada e puxa as r\u00e9deas, ela n\u00e3o iria se render. Colocando sua confian\u00e7a no seu corcel, Llewellyn deixa as r\u00e9deas frouxas e Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata toma a lideran\u00e7a.</p> <p>Llewellyn e Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata mergulham no loda\u00e7al, e mesmo sendo noite e a lama sugava seus cascos, a corcel continuou pressionando. Na hora antes da alvorada, eles chegam em uma ilha com uma torre anci\u00e3. \"A torre do feiticeiro\", Llewellyn pensou. Um trov\u00e3o rolou, e chuva come\u00e7ou a cair.</p> <p>Llewellyn olha para cima e v\u00ea algu\u00e9m performando um ritual sombrio. O brilho de um raio ilumina a figura. Era Melianus! Ele era o feiticeiro! Llewellyn o chamou, e o duque descende da torre e monta no seu corcel infernal. No seu escudo agora destoa o s\u00edmbolo de uma caveira gritando de Cyrvis, o Lich, deus da mal\u00edcia.</p> <p>Cyrvis recompensou seu servo leal pelos seus anos de crueldade, e a figura montada no pesadelo era S\u00e3o Melianus o Brilhante. O Santo sombrio dispara contra Llewellyn, sua lan\u00e7a brilhando um fogo maligno. Llewellyn e Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata devolvem a carga e os dois se chocam, o golpe de Melianus forte o suficiente para mover um gigante. Mas Llewellyn n\u00e3o foi impactado; sua for\u00e7a era a for\u00e7a de dez, pois seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o era puro.</p> <p>Fogo de Carv\u00e3o choca com cascos flamegantes Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata, mas o corcel revida, golpe por mordida e mordida por golpe. Ent\u00e3o o corcel infernal urra e uma chama verde e putrefata queima a carne de Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata, roubando seu f\u00f4lego at\u00e9 que, engasgando, ela cai no ch\u00e3o, morta.</p> <p>O cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Llewellyn estoura, ele se joga sob o corpo da sua leal corcel, e a lan\u00e7a de Melianus atravessa sua armadura, suas costas e seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o. Cavalo e caveliro, mortos. Melianus gargalha enquanto um raio brilha novamente. Mas naquele momento, um milagre.</p> <p>Cavall aparece entre o Santo Sombrio e o leal cavaleiro. Ele puxa a lan\u00e7a das costas de Llewellyn. \"Levante meu filho, e levanta seu corcel, o trabalho de v\u00f3s jamais estar\u00e1s terminado.\"</p> <p>Santo Llewellyn o Valente e Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Prata, seu Corcel Eterno, levantam, imortais, e a batalha contra o mal se renova, os dois santos armados se chocando em corceis armadurados.</p> <p>Semanas depois, com nenhum dos dois retornado, o povo de Gant atravessa o p\u00e2ntano laboriosamente e encontra a torre do feiticeiro. O ch\u00e3o ao redor da torre tornado preto pelas energias sinistras desencadeadas. Ainda que nenhum corpo foi encontrado, a armadura de ambos cavaleiros se encontra no ch\u00e3o.

Lembrava de serem tempos mais simples, os garotos aprendiam a pescar enquanto sonhavam em se tornarem guerreiros, e as garotas aprendiam a fiar enquanto sonhavam em se tornarem princesas.</p> <p>\"Agora parece que tudo foi para os infernos\", ele resmunga para a caneca em sua m\u00e3o. O rio verte vermelho e nauseabundo, o povo parece sempre doente, toda a pesca vai para os soldados do Conde e, como se n\u00e3o bastasse, crian\u00e7as est\u00e3o desaparecendo, sendo ouvidas na noite seguinte berrando de dor em algum lugar da Floresta Sombria.</p> <p>O taverneiro \u00e9 tirado do seu devaneio quando um homem alto, encapuzado, com uma armadura de couro preta e uma espada bastarda pendurada nas costas, entra no recinto. Pela qualidade da roupa e dos broches de prata que adornam sua vestimenta, o taverneiro logo percebe que aquele homem n\u00e3o \u00e9 dali, e pode significar problemas.</p> <p>O homem parece ignorar os olhos postos nele, e n\u00e3o parece perceber, ou se importar, que um grupo de soldados parou o que estavam fazendo para observ\u00e1-lo em sil\u00eancio. Ele chega at\u00e9 o balc\u00e3o, d\u00e1 um suspiro e, mantendo a cabe\u00e7a baixa e tapada pelo capuz, pede uma cerveja.

E, vendo seu querido pai ser enganado e humilhado constantemente devido ao seu car\u00e1ter gentil e humilde, decidiu que ele n\u00e3o seria apenas mais um roth\u00e9; se era para viver ali, que fosse como um warg.</p> <p>Assim ele foi para as ruas, aprendeu a malandragem e desenvolveu seus instintos de ladino com os infames habitantes do submundo, aprendeu a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de todas as vielas e dos principais caminhos secretos da cidade, e entendeu a capital pelo que ela realmente era, um lugar efervescente e plural, com uma mistura de culturas e religi\u00f5es, mas que ainda era um lugar onde todos podiam ser classificados entre aqueles mesmos dois grupos, wargs e roth\u00e9s.</p> <p>Depois de uma noite de jogos trapa\u00e7as em uma taverna local, e tendo lucrado dois drag\u00f5es de ouro nos de dados, Jaime saiu cambaleante para a rua enluarada com seu mais novo amigo e alvo, um humano fanfarr\u00e3o que havia passado a noite se vangloriando sobre como havia trocado um livro de segredos arcanos por um par de frascos de po\u00e7\u00e3o de cura que na verdade n\u00e3o passavam de \u00e1gua do Mar de Espadas enfeiti\u00e7adas.</p> <p>Ao passarem por uma viela mal iluminada, Jaime se aproveitou de uma j\u00e1 esperada distra\u00e7\u00e3o por parte de um casal de pequeninos que passam as noites discutindo e brigando na varanda do seu pr\u00e9dio para afanar o  tal livro de segredos que, em apenas um instante, passou do bolso do casaco do comerciante fanfarr\u00e3o para um compartimento secreto na bolsa de couro de Jaime.</p> <p>Finalmente sozinho no seu esconderijo preferido, Jaime examinou o livro que emanava magia em sua m\u00e3o. Ele descobriu que aquele era o di\u00e1rio de um jovem arcanista chamado Ibbalar Thrul, um aprendiz do not\u00f3rio feiticeiro maluco Halaster Blackcloak, e nele estavam contidos toda forma de experimentos e f\u00f3rmulas m\u00e1gicas para os mais variados feiti\u00e7os. Naquele momento um interesse incomum tomou conta do jovem ladino, que sempre se interessou mais pelo movimento das ruas do que com as li\u00e7\u00f5es da escola de mag\u00edsteres que a sua fam\u00edlia tanto insistia em matricul\u00e1-lo. Tudo naquele livro parecia fant\u00e1stico e inebriante, e ele rapidamente aprendeu os conhecimentos ali contidos, aplicando e aperfei\u00e7oando seus truques e se tornando um perito em feiti\u00e7os de ilus\u00e3o e encantamento. Ele aplicava cada novo aprendizado nos seus truques e lucrava cada vez mais com isso, construindo uma not\u00f3ria carreira no submundo do crime.</p> <p>A partir das passagens e dos pensamentos privados contidos no di\u00e1rio, Jaime foi absorvendo a personalidade do aprendiz Ibbalar, internalizando seu ego imenso e tamb\u00e9m sua impressionante arrog\u00e2ncia, com um crescente sentimento de superioridade perante todos, a n\u00e3o ser ele mesmo, Ibbalar e o seu mestre, Halaster. As mudan\u00e7as foram acontecendo como que por m\u00e1gica, e o jovial brincalh\u00e3o Jaime foi se tornando sedento por dinheiro, cruel e vaidoso, culminando no surgimento do seu alter-ego, Saulo Boaventura.</p> <p>Saulo estava cada vez mais envolvido com as maiores fac\u00e7\u00f5es criminosas da cidade, usando suas novas habilidades arcanas para burlar os sistemas de seguran\u00e7a mais sofisticados, enganar os mais not\u00f3rios agentes p\u00fablicos da grande capital e, por fim, roubar toda riqueza que conseguisse p\u00f4r as m\u00e3os.</p> <p>Cada vez mais absorto na leitura do di\u00e1rio, o jovem ladino ent\u00e3o come\u00e7ou a ser atormentado por vozes cr\u00edpticas que apenas ele parecia ser capaz de ouvir. As ruas e vielas da cidade, que antes eram suas companheiras e aliadas, agora come\u00e7avam a parecer para Jaime como lugares vindos de pesadelos, onde seres sombrios estavam sempre a espreita.</p> <p>Sonhos estranhos passaram a atormentar a mente do rapaz, vis\u00f5es de um opulento castelo encravado na rocha do qual despontava de um teto escuro e \u00famido. Chuva caia desse c\u00e9u de pedra, e o clar\u00e3o dos trov\u00f5es destacava silhuetas antropom\u00f3rficas que desafiavam a l\u00f3gica e a raz\u00e3o, fazendo com que cada c\u00e9lula do corpo de Jaime estremecesse de pavor.</p> <p>Depois de uma noite de bebedeira para apaziguar os pesadelos, Jaime se dirigiu tr\u00f4pego para os seus aposentos, mas ao dobrar uma esquina percebe que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 mais pisando na cal\u00e7ada de pedras lisas da ala comercial, mas sim no piso de um intricado calabou\u00e7o, com paredes iluminadas pelos mais complexos mecanismos, que vertiam ess\u00eancia arcana.</p> <p>Jaime teve a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que j\u00e1 tinha estado naqueles corredores, e mem\u00f3rias muito antigas pareciam vir a sua mente, de tempos em que ele perambulava os sal\u00f5es subterr\u00e2neos da cidade, o lugar de morada do mago louco Halaster e de seu aprendiz Ibbalar, a Undermountain! Guiando-se por esse conhecimento primitivo, ele avan\u00e7ou no calabou\u00e7o labir\u00edntico a passos vacilantes, at\u00e9 que se viu perante um vasto sal\u00e3o, com grossos pilares de pedra talhada, iluminados por gigantescos lustres e que centralizavam sua luz no meio do sal\u00e3o. L\u00e1 um globo negro flutuava acima de um pedestal elevado, coroado pelos ossos de aventureiros que fracassaram em desvendar os segredos do c\u00edrculo m\u00e1gico que parecia proteger o artefato.</p> <p>Jaime sabia que um passo em falso naquele lugar seria a sua ru\u00edna, mas mesmo assim ele avan\u00e7ou confiante, se aproximou do pedestal com passos firmes, evitando aqueles blocos do piso em que ele parecia reconhecer de forma instintiva como sendo armadilhas.</p> <p>O globo negro, agora quase ao seu alcance, parecia um olho, encarando Jaime com sua pupila branca e com o s\u00edmbolo do infinito girando no seu interior. Em todas as suas andan\u00e7as, Jaime nunca tinha visto um tesouro dessa magnitude, ainda assim percebeu em si uma certa familiaridade com o artefato.</p> <p>Logo abaixo do pedestal uma plaqueta podia ser lida em uma l\u00edngua antiga, mas que Jaime, surpreso, leu com facilidade: \"Fa\u00e7a a pergunta certa, e a resposta o libertar\u00e1\".</p> <p>Jaime j\u00e1 tinha lido essa passagem antes, e ao consultar mais uma vez o di\u00e1rio do aprendiz, se deparou com a pergunta que ele buscava. \"Qual o sentido da vida, do universo, e tudo o mais?\". Ele se surpreende ao perguntar ao Orbe naquele mesmo dialeto antigo que ele nunca havia ouvido antes. </p> <p>Uma vibra\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7ou a ser sentida ao redor do pedestal, e onde antes havia uma distor\u00e7\u00e3o da luz ao redor do globo, agora come\u00e7ava a se dissipar, enquanto o Orbe girava para mostrar o seu lado oposto, no qual um buraco escuro e do mais profundo vazio c\u00f3smico podia ser visto. Das profundezas foi emergindo s\u00edmbolos de um numeral que n\u00e3o significava nada para Jaime, mas que dali em diante seria seu mantra e n\u00famero da sorte: 42.</p> <p>Jaime apenas conseguia observar confuso o que estava acontecendo, mas quando percebeu ele estava com orbe nas m\u00e3os, sentindo sem se quer tentar, a magia intr\u00ednseca e anci\u00e3 do objeto que ele agora segurava.</p> <p>Ele mal teve tempo de apreciar o objeto em suas m\u00e3os quando passos apressados come\u00e7aram a ecoar do t\u00fanel as suas costas. Assustado e pressentindo o perigo, Jaime guardou o Orbe em sua bolsa antes de se camuflar nas sombras de um dos cantos do sal\u00e3o.</p> <p>Duas figuras encapuzadas adentraram o sal\u00e3o, e se dirigiram para o pedestal, que agora jazia desativado e dormente. A figura da esquerda tinha chifres que escapavam para fora do seu capuz traiam a sua ra\u00e7a: Era um tiefling, e parecia ser o l\u00edder da dupla.</p> <p>Ele esticou o bra\u00e7o e travou o avan\u00e7o do seu ansioso companheiro, e com uma voz imperiosa e grave disse em idioma comum: \"Espere! Syllabus disse que o Orbe do Conhecimento estaria flutuando em um pedestal no centro do sal\u00e3o e, a n\u00e3o ser que o mapa do calabou\u00e7o esteja errado, era para ser aqui\".</p> <p>Num tom um n\u00edvel acima do seu companheiro, e com uma voz esgani\u00e7ada, a outra figura responde irritada: \"Hummnnha! Eu paguei muito caro nesse maldito mapa pra ele t\u00e1 errado. N\u00e3o, n\u00e3o, ele t\u00e1 certo, tem que t\u00e1 certo, era pra s\u00ea aqui\".</p> <p>O tiefling ent\u00e3o solta um grunhido e avan\u00e7a em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao pedestal, olhando o mapa e se certificando de que estava pisando exatamente nos blocos do piso livres de armadilhas, com o outro capanga o seguindo meio encurvado logo atr\u00e1s.</p> <p>Jaime sabia que havia pouco tempo antes que uma busca mais minusciosa ao sal\u00e3o o descobrisse, ent\u00e3o decidiu agir, usando seu truque de m\u00e3o m\u00e1gica e invis\u00edvel ele pressiona o mecanismo pr\u00f3ximo do teto de pedra, e a luz m\u00e1gica dos lustres estoura em um brilho ofuscante antes de se apagar completamente. Aproveitando-se do breve momento de surpresa e confus\u00e3o da dupla encapuzada, Jaime dispara em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao t\u00fanel, sem se importar em ser sorrateiro. Ele ouve o tiefling gritar um \"Ei!... Atr\u00e1s dele, Grock!\" e se impressiona com a velocidade com que a forma, antes apenas curvada, agora avan\u00e7a em sua dire\u00e7\u00e3o, galopando sobre quatro patas.</p> <p>Jaime viu aquele vulto se aproximando e soube que logo seria alcan\u00e7ado, ele ouve um pigarrear vindo da criatura e ao olhar de relance por cima dos ombros, v\u00ea um jato verde sendo disparado do que parece ser a bocarra de Grock. O jato de \u00e1cido passa raspando pela sua orelha, fazendo um furo na parede de pedra a sua frente, sugerindo que se aquela persegui\u00e7\u00e3o continuasse por muito tempo, ele pr\u00f3prio teria um buraco parecido no seu corpo.</p> <p>Como se ouvisse o apelo do ladino, o caminho a sua frente se bifurcou em dois corredores, que ele aproveitou para criar uma ilus\u00e3o sua e assim confundir o human\u00f3ide serpentino que o persegue. Mas n\u00e3o foi o suficiente, pois depois de um instante de confus\u00e3o Grock pareceu decidido e acaba escolhendo o lado correto, para o desespero de Jaime.</p> <p>Sendo incapaz de confundir os sentidos agu\u00e7ados do Yuan-ti assasino, Jaime acabou apelando para um jogo de esperteza, tentando imitar a voz do chefe tiefling e chamando Grock de volta. A voz partindo do fundo do corredor pareceu ter surgido efeito, pois os segundos de indecis\u00e3o de Grock foram o suficiente para aumentar a dist\u00e2ncia dentre eles, e assim Jaime teve tempo para identificar um mecanismo pr\u00f3ximo a uma sali\u00eancia, que ao ser operado revela uma entrada de servi\u00e7o para os antigos servos de Ibbalar. Com isso Jaime finalmente conseguiu escapar do calabou\u00e7o.</p> <p>Jaime ainda estava se recuperando da sua fuga contra Grock quando seu irm\u00e3o irrompe para dentro do seu esconderijo. \"Carlos! Desde quando sabia do meu esconderijo?\" - Ele disse, alarmado. \"N\u00e3o h\u00e1 tempo para essas explica\u00e7\u00f5es\", seu irm\u00e3o respondeu, \"Voc\u00ea se meteu em uma trama complexa e perigosa, e agora deve apenas me ouvir e fazer exatamente como lhe \u00e9 dito.\"</p> <p>Carlos ent\u00e3o explica que o orbe que Jaime tinha nas m\u00e3os era o Orbe do Conhecimento, um artefato m\u00e1gico e extremamente raro, que havia se tornado o objeto de obsess\u00e3o do chefe da maior organiza\u00e7\u00e3o do submundo de Waterdeep, Syllabus.</p> <p>Syllabus era um beholder que se auto-proclamava descendente direto de Xanathar, e era o Chefe Obscuro da Rede Sombria, uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o do submundo do crime respons\u00e1vel por todo o tipo de opera\u00e7\u00f5es ilegais. Especialista em contrabando, espionagem, chantagem e assassinato, a Rede era a escolha principal dos figur\u00f5es de Waterdeep quando decidiam jogar sujo. Al\u00e9m das volumosas quantias de ouro, seus contratantes acabavam pagando indiretamente com capital pol\u00edtico, que resultou em um crescente controle de Syllabus sobre a guarda da cidade, os comerciantes dos p\u00f3rticos e at\u00e9 mesmo alguns dos altos magistrados.</p> <p>Os mag\u00edsteres de Waterdeep estavam divididos entre aqueles que ca\u00edram pelas garras de Syllabus, aqueles que foram corrompidos por ele e aqueles como Carlos que ainda se mantiam firmes contra o movimento obscuro que tomava conta da ordem da cidade.</p> <p>Ningu\u00e9m al\u00e9m do pr\u00f3prio beholder conhece seus planos para tomar o controle da cidade, mas seu interesse obsessivo no Orbe do Conhecimento sugere que o artefato seja a chave para o seu sucesso.</p> <p>N\u00e3o demora muito para Syllabus descobrir quem era o ladr\u00e3o arcano que fugiu com o seu tesouro, o infame astro do crime que tomou as ruas de supet\u00e3o com a sua insanidade carism\u00e1tica e seu talento nato para ilus\u00f5es e encantamentos: Saulo Boaventura.</p> <p>Com isso Carlos tra\u00e7ou seu plano com os mag\u00edsteres e a Alian\u00e7a dos Lordes, e quando Jaime foi atra\u00eddo para Undermountain pelo livro de magias de Ibbalar, esse plano foi posto em movimento. Os agentes do reino atacaram as bases da Rede de forma coordenada e sofrendo grandes perdas, mas conseguiram atrasar os movimentos de Syllabus o suficiente para Jaime destravar os segredos e as armadilhas que circundavam o Orbe do Conhecimento. Agora que ele o tinha em m\u00e3os, deveria entregar para seu irm\u00e3o e ent\u00e3o fugir em ex\u00edlio, apenas com a esperan\u00e7a de que a f\u00faria do beholder se arrefe\u00e7a o suficiente para ele um dia poder voltar para casa.</p> <p>Aquele turbilh\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es atordoou os pensamentos de Jaime, e antes que ele pudesse entregar o artefato para seu irm\u00e3o uma fuma\u00e7a espessa come\u00e7ou a subir a partir das fissuras do ch\u00e3o de madeira do esconderijo. O cheiro caracter\u00edstico de p\u00f3lvora \u00e9 sentido pelos irm\u00e3os momentos antes da explos\u00e3o, que abriu um rombo no canto oposto do recinto, acompanhado por um enxame de figuras encapuzadas que escalaram as paredes e tomaram conta de todo o per\u00edmetro, lideradas por uma voz estridente que Jaime reconheceu como pertencendo \u00e0 Grock, o human\u00f3ide serpentino que agora liderava um esquadr\u00e3o de assassinos Yuan-ti.</p> <p>Os irm\u00e3os foram varados por disparos de dardos envenenados e sprays de veneno, mas acabam poupados dos impactos pelo surgimento s\u00fabito de uma barreira m\u00e1gica. Jaime se v\u00ea estupefato pelo autor do feiti\u00e7o, era Carlos, que agora deixava aparecer de dentro dos seus robes um bracelete dourado, com intricados s\u00edmbolos arcanos, que pulsam com uma luz arroxeada.</p> <p>\"\u00c9 maninho, parece que o interesse pelo arcano vem de fam\u00edlia\", Carlos disse com um sorriso triste no rosto, \"E n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 voc\u00ea que aprendeu alguns novos truques ultimamente\". Com isso ele toma uma posi\u00e7\u00e3o de poder, abrindo um pouco mais as pernas, flexionando elas levemente e firmando os p\u00e9s no ch\u00e3o, abre as duas m\u00e3os como se estivesse segurando algo entre as palmas e faz um movimento circular, canalizando energias de baixo para cima. Um tremor come\u00e7ou a ser sentido nas t\u00e1buas do ch\u00e3o de madeira, e um borbulhar vermelho aparece logo a frente de Carlos, no qual subitamente uma parede de fogo irrompe, tostando os assassinos mais pr\u00f3ximos e jogando os outros para tr\u00e1s.</p> <p>\"N\u00e3o temos mais tempo, pegue o Orbe e leve para bem longe daqui, Syllabus n\u00e3o pode p\u00f4r seus tent\u00e1culos imundos nele de jeito nenhum!\" Jaime n\u00e3o queria ouvir, \"N\u00e3o vou deix\u00e1-lo para tr\u00e1s, podemos venc\u00ea-los juntos!\" Mas Carlos o interrompe, \"Depois dessa explos\u00e3o toda a guarda da cidade vir\u00e1 ao nosso encontro, voc\u00ea e o Orbe n\u00e3o podem ser capturados, muitos dos guardas j\u00e1 est\u00e3o submissos a Syllabus, e nem eu poderia salv\u00e1-lo do sistema.\"</p> <p>Jaime ainda tentou teimosamente argumentar, mas ambos sabiam o que tinha de ser feito e que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 outra alternativa. A troca de olhares mareados dos irm\u00e3os era ao mesmo tempo uma despedida e um voto de confian\u00e7a de que tudo iria ficar bem.</p> <p>Grock amaldi\u00e7oava o humano arrogante que o tinha feito de bobo nos corresdores, e o seu irm\u00e3o de robes pomposos com seus truques m\u00e1gicos. Fez um sinal para que o resto do bando atacasse. \"Vamos rapazes, pela luzinha fraca daquele treco m\u00e1gico, ele t\u00e1 ficando sem suco, ataquem! Agora! Cuidado com os truques daquele ali, n\u00e3o o deixem escapar!\" Mas j\u00e1 era tarde demais, Carlos canalizava o restante de energia arcana presente no seu bracelete para conjurar um raio de luz colorida que desintegrou um dos capangas ao lado de Grock, cegando-o e atordoando todos os demais ao seu redor. Depois disso n\u00e3o havia mais sinais do ladino arcano nem do artefato lend\u00e1rio que os Yuan-ti haviam vindo pegar.</p> <p>\"Que bagun\u00e7a, e bem no meio da rua dos Joalheiros.\", resmunga Dresden Punho de Ferro, chefe da guarda da cidade. Ele odiava aquele lugar, aquela cidade, aquele bras\u00e3o e todo o peso que vinha com aquilo, mas acima de tudo ele odiava a si mesmo e a sua fraqueza perante os dados, que lhe rendeu uma d\u00edvida estratosf\u00e9rica capaz de manter toda a sua fam\u00edlia ref\u00e9m de criminosos. Ele olha para o seus colegas, todos homens de honra, com fam\u00edlia, filhos, e interesses sombrios sendo explorados pela Rede. S\u00f3 restava a Dresden suspirar, mandar eles limparem aquela bagun\u00e7a e ir reportar a situa\u00e7\u00e3o ao Conselho.</p> <p>Obrigado Mestre Kayder pela revis\u00e3o!</p>"},{"location":"TTRPG/lovecraftian-horror/cthulhu-mythos/","title":"The Cthulhu Mythos","text":"<p>As written in Call of Cthulhu RPG.</p> <p>Based on the premise that knowledge and sanity are contraditory things. The more the human grasp the true extend of the cosmos the more it will lose his mind.</p>"},{"location":"TTRPG/lovecraftian-horror/cthulhu-mythos/#a-general-summary","title":"A General Summary","text":"<p>We know that some entities of the Cthulhu Mythos are clearly superior or inferior in their powers. Gods are the mightiest, followed by the Great Old Ones. The universe is ruled by beigns variously known as the Elder Gods, Outer Gods, or Other Gods. Only a few of these deities are known by name. They are all extremely powerful alien beigns and some may be of extra-cosmic origin. The Outer Gods rule the yniverse and have little to do with humanity, except for Nyarlathotep. They appear almost to be true gods, as opposed to the alien horror of the Great Old Ones, and some may personify a cosmic principle. Only a few seems to be interested in the human race, mainly using them to break through cosmic walls or dimensions, to wreak havoc. Those unfortunate souls that enter in contact with the gods end up dead or insane. All the races and lesser deities of the Mythos acknowledge the Outer Gods, and many worship them.</p> <p>The Outer Gods are controlled to some extent by their messenger and soul, Nyarlathotep. When the Outer Gods are discomforted, Nyarlathotep investigates. Azathoth, the daemon sultan and ruler of the cosmos, writhes mindlessly to the piping of a demon flute at the center of the universe. Yog-Sothoth, either a second-in-command or co-ruler, is coterminous with all time and sapce, but locked somehow outside the mundane universe. Yog-Sothoth can be summoned to this side only through the use of might spells, but Azathoth can only be seen by traveling far enough through space. A group of Outer Gods and bizarre beigns dance slowly around Azathoth, but none are named.</p> <p>The term Elder Gods sometimes refers to another race of gods, neutral to and possibly rivals of the Outer Gods. They don't seem as dangerous to humankind as the Outer Gods, and Nodens is the best-known of its kind.</p> <p>Both Outer and Elder Gods are sometimes called Other Gods, but this term primarily refer to gods of the outer planets and not of our Earth. Confusingly, a set of minor Outer Gods are known collectively as the Lesser Other Gods. Species associated with Other Gods are deities such as the shantaks, hunting horrors, servitors of the Outer Gods and dark young of Shub-Niggurath. They are sometimes called here and when they do appear is to wreak horror.</p> <p>The Great Old Ones are not as supernatural as the Outer Gods, but are nonetheless god-like and terrible to human eyes. Humans are much more likely to worship Great Old Ones, who are comparatively near at hand and who occasionally participate in human affairs or contact individual humans, than they are to worship Outer Gods. Entire clans or cults may secretly worship Outer Gods, and they  frequently inhabit remote parts of the Earth. Investigators most often encounter their worshipers and alien servants.</p> <p>The Great Old Ones appear to be immensely powerful alien beings with supernatural-like abilities, but not to be true gods in the sense that the Outer Gods are reported. Each Great Old One is independent of the rest and many seem to be temporarily imprisoned in some way. It is said that, \"When the stars are right,\" the Gread Old Ones can plunge from world to world. When the stars are not right, they cannot live. \"Cannot live\" need not mean death, as the famous couplet from the Necronomicon suggests:</p> <p>That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.</p> <p>Cthulhu is a Great Old One, and the most important one. With the rest of his race, he sleeps in a vast tomb at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Others of different forms exist and they are recorded as being both less powerful and more free than Cthulhu. But all those known on Earth are invoked or worshiped by humans. Some minor Great Old Ones may have no worshipers, but wizards may know spells to summon them.</p> <p>Other alien species are also important, and sometimes have been able to hold their own against Great Old Ones. Such beings vary in power and some are now extinct. At the dawn of the Cambrian age, beings known only as the elder things flew to the Earth. They inhabited much of the land, warred with other species, and finally were pushed back to Antarctica. The elder things, perhaps mistakenly, bred organisms eventually to evolve into the dinosaurs, mammals, and humanity. They also bred the horrible shoggoths, whose ultimate revolt led to the near-extinction of the elder things.</p>"},{"location":"TTRPG/lovecraftian-horror/intro/","title":"Lovecraftian Horror RPGs","text":"<p>I'm looking into an RPG game with an OSR vibe.

E que depois da segunda guerra foi feito um revisionismo hist\u00f3rico pra disvencilhar a ideologia nazista da ideologia colonialista europeia e do preconceito antissemita americano.</p> <p>Ent\u00e3o o verdadeiro crime do fascismo foi a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em pessoas brancas de procedimentos coloniais \"que at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o tinham sido reservados exclusivamente para os \u00c1rabes da Algeria, os 'coolies' da \u00cdndia, e os 'negros' da \u00c1frica\".

Como os burgueses e os cientistas argumentavam sobre como usar o povo colonizado nos seus surtos de viol\u00eancia, afim de mant\u00ea-la longe das suas cidades \"civilizadas\". De como eles tiveram que justificar usando argumentos racistas, que diziam o branco ser uma \"ra\u00e7a superior\", e por fim aplicando apagamento hist\u00f3rico pra corroborar suas falsas premissas de povo n\u00e3o civilizado, sumindo com toda a cultura, toda a tecnologia e toda a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica e social que fosse diferente daquela europeia.</p> <p>Al\u00e9m do lado racista, tem a justificativa teol\u00f3gica de que os povos colonizados n\u00e3o esperam qualidade de vida, apenas respeito pela sua tradi\u00e7\u00e3o e religi\u00e3o local, e que esses povos v\u00eaem o homem branco como algo divino e aben\u00e7oado, numa alta posi\u00e7\u00e3o hierarquica.</p> <p>Al\u00e9m disso, o lado cient\u00edfico vem tamb\u00e9m a partir da psican\u00e1lise, quando um tal M.

Uhtred ent\u00e3o se passa de dinamarques e entra na cidade atr\u00e1s do rei. O encontra inconciente, machucado e com suas roubadas, mas n\u00e3o antes de ver Staepa acorrentado e sendo obrigado a lutar, para o divertimento dos dinamarqueses b\u00eabados. Alfredo agora recuperado decide visitar a catedral, se recusando a ir embora. L\u00e1 encontram mais um contingente de soldados descansando e jogando dados. Uhtred insiste em ir embora quando uma voz chama o seu nome, e um cachorro vem at\u00e9 seus p\u00e9s, o cachorro era Nightgenga, da sua antiga companheira, e a voz era de Ragnar, dado como morto por estar como ref\u00e9m dos sax\u00f5es.</p> <p>Uhtred conversa com Ragnar e descobre como ele continua vivo. Isso foi devido \u00e0 tra\u00ed\u00e7\u00e3o de Wulfere, parente de Alfredo e o ealdorman respons\u00e1vel pela guarni\u00e7\u00e3o dos ref\u00e9ns. Uhtred fica tentado a ir para o lado dos dinamarqueses, mas decide continuar com os sax\u00f5es. Ao foltar para o p\u00e2ntano, Alfredo recebe not\u00edcias de Defnascir e de Odda, O Jovem. Decide ent\u00e3o enviar Uhtred junto com Staepa para l\u00e1, em busca dos homens de Svein, do qual Odda n\u00e3o tem not\u00edcias.</p> <p>Viajando para o oeste, a dupla de guerreiros Uhtred e Staepa descobrem que os dinamarqueses fizeram as pazes com Odda, o Jovem. O ealdorman est\u00e1 convencido de que wessex ir\u00e1 cair para os dinamarqueses, e que Svein coroar\u00e1 Odda como o rei sax\u00e3o. Seu pai est\u00e1 doente e sob cuidados de Mildrith, que deseja virar freira agora que sei filho morreu. Uhtred morreu engasgado, no mesmo dia em que Eduardo reviveu, e as palavras de Iseult ressoaram, dizendo como uma crian\u00e7a deve morrer para uma outra reviver. No fim, Odda e Svein chegam ao castelo de Harald para impedir a reuni\u00e3o do reeve, ordenada por Alfredo, e ao ver Uhtred e Svein juntos Odda exige que o combate seja retomado. Mas para a surpresa de todos Staepa ataca Odda e o mata com um golpe de espada na garganta. Com isso Svein tem sua tr\u00e9gua quebrada e se v\u00ea obrigado a se juntar com Guthrum em Cippanham.</p> <p>Com o fim do inverno os ex\u00e9rcitos come\u00e7am a se reunir. Alfredo convoca todos os seus chefes para reunirem o fyrd, isso \u00e9, qualquer campon\u00eas capaz de lutar. Guthrum faz o mesmo pois v\u00ea uma oportunidade para derrotar de vez as for\u00e7as de Wessex. Um novo personagem surge, o divertido padre Pyrlig, antigo guerreiro brit\u00e2nico que se junta aos sax\u00f5es de Uhtred. A batalha se prepara na Pedra de Egbert.</p> <p>Alfredo est\u00e1 com seu ex\u00e9rcito reunido e esperando algum movimento de Guthrum. Por conta disso, envia Uhtred e o padre Pyrlig como batedores para descobrir o paradeiro dos dinamarqueses. Os dois acabam descobrindo um acampamento de batedores dinamarqueses e sax\u00f5es, e para sua surpresa se deparam com uma voz pedante que s\u00f3 pode ser do primo do rei, Aethelwold. Uhtred o captura e o devolve ao rei com as informa\u00e7\u00f5es de que Guthrum marcha com 5 mil homens. Os dois ex\u00e9rcitos ent\u00e3o se preparam para a batalha. Guthrum encontra uma fortaleza do povo antigo e ali espera o ataque sax\u00e3o, com o ex\u00e9rcito de Svein e os sax\u00f5es desertores na sua esquerda.</p> <p>A guerra irrompe entre as tropas de Alfredo e Svein, enquanto Guthrum assiste tudo da sua fortaleza do povo antigo. A selvageria dos sax\u00f5es foi o suficiente para conter os dinamarqueses, mas n\u00e3o sem baixas. Os cavaleiros de Svein esperavam os desertores de Alfredo e encontraram as mulheres e crian\u00e7as que ficaram na retaguarda com os cavalos. Elas lutaram e resistiram, e Hild foi salva de sua f\u00faria atr\u00e1s daqueles que a estupraram devido a Iseult, que se sacrificou no seu lugar. Alfredo vai negociar uma tr\u00e9gua mas os vikings a ignoram, e no fim aguardam a investida sax\u00e3 \u00e0 sua fortaleza de cima do morro. Eles n\u00e3o esperavam que a parte mais dif\u00edcil de ser acessada assim o fosse, e por n\u00e3o proteg\u00ea-la o suficiente acabou por ser rompida. Leofric morre com um machado na coluna e Uhtred salva Ragnar de ser cercado pelos soldados sax\u00e3os.</p>"},{"location":"lore/cronicas-saxonicas/livro-3-senhor-do-norte/","title":"Livro 3: Senhor do Norte","text":"<p>Depois da guerra, os sax\u00f5es retomam wessex, e Uhtred recebe um lugar miseravel como recompensa. Decide ent\u00e3o largar tudo, esconder seu tesouro e ir para o norte, vingar a morte de seu pai sax\u00e3o, pelas m\u00e3os de Kjartan, o Cruel. Ele viaja de navio com Hild, a freira resgatada por Uhtred em Witancaester, onde estava como prostituta para os dinamarqueses.</p> <p>Uhtred chega \u00e0 capital da Nort\u00fambria e descobre que a not\u00edcia da vit\u00f3ria de Alfredo inflamou os sax\u00f5es, que se levantaram contra os dinamarqueses de Ivarr. Uhtred se junta com o comerciante Bollt e vai para o norte, passando pelas terras de Kjartan. Ele encontra Svein comerciando escravos e se v\u00ea obrigado a encar\u00e1-lo. Ele ent\u00e3o usa seu novo cavalo de guerra, Witnere, para incapacitar os capangas e voa em Svein, o mantendo ref\u00e9m de sua faca. As filhas do comerciante matam o comerciante de escravos, e Uhtred aproveita a deixa para dizer que elas s\u00e3o enviadas de Hel, a deusa dos cad\u00e1veres, e diz que ele, Tropkjin o Leproso \u00e9 enviado de Odin para matar Kjartan e Svein.</p> <p>Uhtred deixa Sven humilhado no ch\u00e3o e assiste enquanto um jovem forte e loiro, com correntes nos pulsos, se afasta de padres que vieram rezando. Ele se abaixa e pega uma espada no ch\u00e3o, indo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a Sven. Uhtred o convence de que deve deixar o Caolho vivo. E o jovem resolve se unir ao guerreiro. Ele se diz rei do oeste da Nortumbria, Guthred filho de Hafdansir. Eles ent\u00e3o se dirigem em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 cidade, onde Uhtred conhece Gisela, irm\u00e3 de Guthred.</p> <p>Uhtred e Guthred foram coroados pelo abade Eadred, assim unindo sax\u00f5es e dinamarqueses, crist\u00e3os e pag\u00e3os sobre o mesmo estandarte.</p> <p>Uhtred e Guthred v\u00e3o caminhar na margem de um rio e s\u00e3o surpreendidos pelos cavaleiros negros que estavam disfar\u00e7ados como aliados vindos de Dunholm. Uhtred estava prestes a ter um olho arrancado quando seus jovens aprendizes vem para resgat\u00e1-lo. Uhtred ent\u00e3o recompensa eles e descobre que Kjartan tem vastos tesouros, protegidos pelos seus cachorros de ca\u00e7a. Sven \u00e9 um covarde medroso e Thyra Ragnardotherr est\u00e1 viva, insana e protegida por Kjartan por ter vis\u00f5es do futuro. Um dos cavaleiros negros era apenas um garoto, Sithric, que \u00e9 filho bastardo de Kjartan, sendo poupado por Uhtred e virando um de seus homens. Eles ent\u00e3o chegam em Eoferwic e tomam a cidade sem luta. Egbert suplica por sua vida e Guthred a concede. Se espelhando na bondade de Alfredo.</p> <p>O povo de Guthred est\u00e1 pronto para marchar para o norte em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos lordes inimigos, Kjartan, Ivarr e Aethelred. Recebem a not\u00edcia de que Ivarr foi derrotado e estava ferido, numa batalha sangrenta contra Aed da esc\u00f3cia. Ivarr se rendeu a guthred e foi poupado, combinando em casa Gisela com seu filho Ivar Ivarrson. Mas para isso ele exige a fortaleza de Kjartan, Dunholm. Recuperando assim a sua for\u00e7a.</p> <p>Guthred se dirige \u00e0 Dunholm, a fortaleza de Kjartan. Uhtred descobre que Ivarr jurou lealdade em troca da fortaleza, e que Guthred pretende casar sua irm\u00e3 com o filho hom\u00f4nimo de Ivarr. Uhtred diz que tem um plano e pede a fortaleza para si. Ele ent\u00e3o se veste de cavaleiro sombrio e colocou as cabe\u00e7as dos infiltrados cavaleiros negros em ordem diante de si e da fortaleza, amedrontando Kjartan e seus homens. Depois disso, Guthred deve convenc\u00ea-lo a desistir ou uma guerra ir\u00e1 tomar conta</p> <p>Uhtred prometeu Dunholm \u00e0 Guthred, e em troca disso o rei deveria dar a ele a fortaleza, ao inv\u00e9s de Ivarr. Uhtred ent\u00e3o vai escondido e disfar\u00e7ado do morto Throvik aterrorizar Kjartan, confiante de que isso seria suficiente para o Cruel negociar seu ex\u00edlio no dia seguinte. Por\u00e9m, ele \u00e9 tra\u00eddo por Ivarr que deixa transparecer que, na verdade ele, Uhtred, era o cavaleiro morto. Com a negocia\u00e7\u00e3o dando errado, Guthred decide ir para Gyruum ca\u00e7ar. Uhtred o acompanha, por\u00e9m, \u00e9 tra\u00eddo pelo jovem rei, que negociava com seu tio Aelfric em troca da vida de Uhtred, e assim ele perde sua espada e vira escravo.</p> <p>O dono do navio Mercante se chamava Sverri Ravnson. Um homem baixo, forte e atento que navegava com quatro tripulantes e 11 escravos nos remos. Uhtred se tornou amigo de um deles, um escoc\u00eas carrancudo e guerreiro que foi capturado em batalha. Eles viajaram para todos os lados trocando mercadorias, e passavam os invernos na casa de Sverri. Viajaram longamente at\u00e9 Thule, uma das ilhas do fogo do norte da Brit\u00e2nia. L\u00e1 eles se deparam com o Navio Vermelho.</p> <p>As viagens continuavam at\u00e9 que um dia surge no horizonte um navio vermelho. Seu drag\u00e3o na pompa sugere que sejam piratas, e claramente est\u00e3o perseguindo Sverri. Ele n\u00e3o sabe quem pode ter rixa com ele, mas pede para seu senhor, Hyrig para descobrir. Enquanto isso, o Mercante \u00e9 levado por \u00e1guas conturbadas e p\u00e2ntanos para escapar do drag\u00e3o dinamarqu\u00eas vermelho em forma de navio.</p> <p>O navio vermelho persegue Sverri por\u00e9m sem sucesso. Ent\u00e3o ele volta para a Brit\u00e2nia em busca de novas mercadorias. Decide ir at\u00e9 a Nort\u00fambria atr\u00e1s de escravos para transportar. O vendedor dos escravos era Sven, que suspeita de Uhtred, mesmo ele mentindo ser Osbert, seu primeiro nome. Sven o descobre mas ele consegue se soltar e tenta fugir pelo rio. Sven o persegue mas recua ao ver no horizonte o navio vermelho.</p> <p>O navio vermelho era Ragnar e Staepa. E estavam atr\u00e1s de Sverri para resgatar Uhtred. Hild foi at\u00e9 Alfredo e prometeu construir um monast\u00e9rio caso ele ajudasse a resgatar Uhtred. Ele ent\u00e3o deu essa tarefa aos dois. Agora Uhtred retomou suas posses e foi convocado a uma festa da igreja de Alfredo. Ele ficou sabendo que a filha do rei iria se casa com seu primo da M\u00e9rcia, o Aethelfred</p> <p>Uhtred conversa com Offa o artista domador de c\u00e3es que serve como espi\u00e3o para Alfredo. Ele trouxe not\u00edcias da Nort\u00fambria, onde Aelfric fortifica Bebbanburg, Guthred reina como um bom crist\u00e3o e um tolo dinamarqu\u00eas, Ivarr retoma seu poder com ouro de Kjartan e esse \u00faltimo se espalha comprando amigos. Kjartan queria se unir a Guthred casando Gisela e Sven, ela fugiu para um mosteiro como freira para evitar esse destino. Enquanto isso Guthrum, agora o crist\u00e3o Aethelstan, reina em M\u00e9rcia e negocia paz com Alfredo, dividindo o reino da Brit\u00e2nia em dois.</p> <p>Uhtred presencia o casamento de Aethelflaed com seu primo Aethelred, da mercia. Ele ent\u00e3o \u00e9 convocado por Alfredo, que exige seu juramento, al\u00e9m de envi\u00e1-lo como escolta para o padre Beocca, que deve ir \u00e0 Nort\u00fambria tratar com Guthred sobre como lidar com Ivarr e Kjartan.</p> <p>Uhtred vai atr\u00e1s de Guthred e descobre que ele havia trocado Gisela e o corpo de s\u00e3o Cuthbert pelos homens de Aelfric da Bebbanburg. Por\u00e9m ao ficarem sabendo disso, Ivarr e Kjartan foram ca\u00e7\u00e1-lo para assim impedir o casamento. Guthred emt\u00e3o se refugia em uma antiga fortaleza romana e \u00e9 salvo por Uhtred e Ragnar.</p> <p>Uhtred salva Guthred de um cerco feito pelos homens de Kjartan. Ele discute com os padres e homens de Aelthred de que Gisela n\u00e3o \u00e9 casada, e acaba matando Jaenhert em sua f\u00faria. Ele convence Guthred de atacar Dunholm enquanto Kjartan pensa que estao indo para Bebbanburg, e parte para uma infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o no escuro com Staepa, Sihtric, Clapa.</p> <p>Uhtred guia seus guerreiros pela noite atrav\u00e9s de um temporal maligno. Ele enfim consegue dar a volta em Dunholm e chega em um po\u00e7o externo que deve ser acessado abrindo um port\u00e3o. Assim eles conseguem se esgueirar para dentro da fortaleza, matando silenciosamente os vigias. L\u00e1 dentro s\u00e3o descobertos e tudo parece perdido, pois os c\u00e3es demon\u00edacos de Kjartan s\u00e3o liberados contra eles. Um grito estridente impede a investida dos c\u00e3es, e uma mulher nua, magra e com marcas de cortes pelo corpo surge. Era Thyra, irm\u00e3 de Ragnar que foi sequestrada por Sven. Ela enlouqueceu durante seus anos de cativeiro e agora cantava para os c\u00e3es, controlando-os. Assim os homens de Kjartan n\u00e3o conseguiram resistir aos c\u00e3es e Uhtred conseguiu abrir o port\u00e3o para o exercito de Ragnar entrar. Thyra manda seus c\u00e3es trucidarem Sven da virilha para cima, e Ragnar vence Kjartan em combate singular. Thyra ent\u00e3o se vira furiosa contra Ragnar, dizendo que ele nao veio salva-la. E teria sido o fim do seu irm\u00e3o se n\u00e3o fosse pelo padre Beocca, que surge pelo meio dos c\u00e3es e abra\u00e7a Thyra.</p> <p>Uhtred desce para Cethrec e aguarda o ataque de Ivarr e seu ex\u00e9rcito. Eles n\u00e3o tinham esperan\u00e7a de vence-lo na parede de escudos, ent\u00e3o Uhtred bolou um plano. Ele pediu para O escoc\u00eas Finan roubar o fio de ouro da barba de s\u00e3o Oswald, e prometeu toda sua prata \u00e0 igreja se ele, Uhtred, n\u00e3o encontrasse o ladr\u00e3o. O padre Hrothwerd, que convenceu Guthred de cobrar ped\u00e1gio dos dinamarqueses, acusava todos os pag\u00e3os e principalmente Uhtred do roubo. Mas, depois de provocar Ivarr e mata-lo em combate singular, Uhtred acusou o padre, e Finan jurou ter encontrado o ouro nas roupas do crist\u00e3o vil. Assim, Uhtred conseguiu o ex\u00e9rcito de Ivarr para Guthred e se livrou do seu pior e mais odiado inimigo na corte.</p>"},{"location":"lore/cronicas-saxonicas/livro-4-cancao-da-espada/","title":"Livro 4: A Can\u00e7\u00e3o da Espada","text":"<p>Uhtred est\u00e1 defendendo o rio T\u00e2misa da invas\u00e3o dos vikings que por duas vezes conseguiram escapar.

Depois em Coccham na fortaleza refor\u00e7ada, ou burh, de uhtred ele recebe o sobrinho do rei, Aethelwold, que est\u00e1 s\u00f3brio e diz que falou com um morto dinamarques que afirmou que ele ser\u00e1 rei de wessex, e uhtred de mercia.</p> <p>Um comerciante dinamarques chega e diz para Uhtred que os irm\u00e3os noruegueses Siegfrid e Erik se uniram a Haesten em Lundene e formam uma frota com 31 navios. Haesten era um dinamarques jurado a Uhtred que o traiu e se juntou aos dinamarqueses depois do assalto em Witancaester. Depois de reportar isso Alfredo chega e interroga Uhtred sobre sua lealdade e sobre as inten\u00e7\u00f5es de seu primo, dizendo que pretende dar a terra sem rei da M\u00e9rcia para o primo de Uhtred, Aethelred, que vai se casar com a filha mais velha do rei, Aethelflead. Mas para isso Uhtred precisa recuperar a agora dominada Lundene, se livrando dos noruegueses e sua frota. Algumas semanas depois um homem vem a Uhtred e o leva at\u00e9 a M\u00e9rcia para ver o morto que fala, e l\u00e1 se encontra com Haesten no castelo de earl Eilaf. Eles sacrificam um sax\u00e3o acusado de roubo e v\u00eaem uma tumba se erguer, clamando por falar com o skald morto Bjorn.</p> <p>Uhtred fala com o morto e todos estao apavorados menos Haesten. O morto diz que ele ser\u00e1 rei da mercia e uhtred acredita, sendo tomado pela possibilidade de poder. Depois recebe um banquete e concorda em seguir o plano dos dinamarqueses, quebrando a promessa de Alfredo. Ele se encontra com siegfrid e erik em lundene. O primeiro \u00e9 carismatico mas se enfurece facil, o segundo \u00e9 jovem e amigavel, e uhtred gostou imediatamente dele. Estavam em volta de uma cruz e queriam ver como poderia alguem morrer crucificado. Para isso havia prisioneiros, tr\u00eas padres enviados por Guthrum, o dinamarques cristianizado e subserviente a alfredo que governava a Anglia Oriental. Mas um deles era o padre Pyrlig, antigo amigo de Uhtred, e ao velo ele sugere dar uma chance ao patetico padre gordo, dizendo para lutar por sua vida. Siegfrid gosta da ideia e \u00e9 convencido a ele mesmo lutar contra o prisioneiro, que recebe a espada de Uhtred e finge n\u00e3o saber o que fazer com ela, mas tanto ele como Uhtred sabiam que o padre era um antigo conhecido do a\u00e7o.</p> <p>O padre Pyrlig finge estar desconfort\u00e1vel mas vence a luta em tr\u00eas golpes, decepando um dos dedos de Siegfrid.

Uhtred encontra Trysha e ela est\u00e1 gr\u00e1vida de Beocca, e o padre n\u00e3o pode estar mais feliz com ela. Um rapaz monge fica cuidando Uhtred e se aproxima com uma reverencia, ele \u00e9 Osfrid, filho bastardo do rei Alfredo com a irm\u00e3 de Leofric, o antigo mestre de armas de Uhtred. Ele \u00e9 rexa\u00e7ado por beocca mas ele o ignora e pede para ir com Uhtred se tornar um guerreiro, Uhtred aceita.</p> <p>Uhtred apresenta seu plano de como tomar Lundene, mas sabia que seu primo falastr\u00e3o iria mela-lo e por isso omite alguns detalhes. Chegando finalmente l\u00e1 eles se reunem e Aethelred decide que ele ira liderar o ataque principal enquanto Uhtred come\u00e7a o ataque chamariz. Mas ele sabia que isso era um plano \u00f3bvio e que Siegfrid esperaria por isso, ent\u00e3o decidiu trair o plano original e tentar acessar escondido a cidade a partir de uma passagem entre a muralha do rio, onde antigamente um nobre decidiu quebra-la para o seu ancoradouro privado. Steapa se junta a Uhtred por ordem de Alfredo, que diz que deve mat\u00e1-lo caso ele se junte aos dinamarqueses, pois o padre Asser diz n\u00e3o confiar nele.</p> <p>Uhtred se prepara para invadir Lundene mas precisa de homens. Ele pede para Egbert mas ele se recusa, pois n\u00e3o gosta dele. Mas Aetheflaed aparece e obriga Egbert a dar homens para Uhtred se ele jurasse lealdade \u00e0 princesa e \u00e0 mercia. Ent\u00e3o consegue seus homens e avan\u00e7a pela passagem estreita da ponte. Consegue passar e desembarca na cidade velha.</p> <p>Uhtred chega at\u00e9 uma das portas internas e v\u00ea os homens de Sigefrid avan\u00e7arem rumo \u00e0 cidade sax\u00e3. Ele ataca os poucos guardas no port\u00e3o e deixa a porta aberta para atrair Sigefrid. Funciona e a luta na parede de escudos come\u00e7a, mas ainda n\u00e3o h\u00e1 sinal das tropas de Aethelred.</p> <p>Uhtred monta uma parede de escudos no arco onde abriu a porta. Siegfrid vem e tenta romper sua parede com machados longos mas cai quando o padre Pyrlig manda desmoronar o topo do arco em cima deles. O jovem Osferth pula atr\u00e1s do norueges e o atordoa, quando Uhtred enfia sua l\u00e2mina na sua coxa e o rapaz crava sua espada nas suas costas. Depois disso vem os homens de Aethelred e a batalha se encerra. Erik negocia a vida de seus homens com Uhtred e n\u00e3o pede nada em troca do navio que deu a seu irm\u00e3o, O domador de Mares. Aldhelm o comandante das tropas de Aethelred insulta Gisela e apanha de Uhtred, que descobre que a Rainha da M\u00e9rcia Aethelflaed est\u00e1 gr\u00e1vida e que seu primo bate nela por c\u00edume de Uhtred.</p> <p>Alfredo chega a Lundene e declara que o bispo Erkenwald ficar\u00e1 como governante, enquanto Uhtred ser\u00e1 o comandante militar e Aethelred como o thegn que serve \u00e0 wesex. Eles s\u00e3o convocados por Alfredo \u00e0 uma missa onde Erkenwald prega para Aetheflaed sobre ser submissa ao marido, e sobre os planos de defender Lundene e tirar Sigfried de Beamfleot. Uhtred viaja de navio fingindo ser mercador e mata uma tripula\u00e7\u00e3o viking, depois vai para a costa de Beamfleot e mostra quem ele \u00e9. Um novo comandante viking vem da franquia e ataca Hrofecaester, onde Alfredo ataca e recupera a cidade. Esperando os navios de Aethelred para cortar a fuga dos dinamarqueses ele fica enrolando o seu lider com negocia\u00e7\u00f5es infrut\u00edferas. Mas depois de dois dias sem os navios de Lundene o dinamarques percebe e foge. Enquanto isso Aethelred diz que a cerveja da tripula\u00e7\u00e3o estava estragada e manda reabastecer todos os navios, pois seus guerreiros n\u00e3o poderiam lutar sem. Fica julgando o tribunal da cidade no lugar do bispo e evita uhtred e gisela. Mas l\u00e1 \u00e9 um local aberto a todos e eles enfim conseguem ver Aethelflaed. Ela de subito geme de dor e parece a ponto de vomitar quando duas aias a retiram do local. Depois disso gisela chama uhtred de canto e eles conversam com a princesa. Ela diz que est\u00e1 preocupada com a gravidez e que a meia noite na igreja os homens irao testa-la para saber se o filho \u00e9 realmente do seu primo Aethelred.</p> <p>Uhtred gisela e finan vao ate a igreja para descobrir o que vai acontecer com Aethelflaed. L\u00e1 eles veem um ritual onde o bispo erkenwald manda a garota tomar agua benta e a condena a apodrecer caso tenha sido desleal ao marido. Uma velha ent\u00e3o se aproxima para levantar a saia da princesa, e ela grita que nao. Mas Aldhem a segura pelos ombros e bate nela com tapas e cascudos. Uhtred entao grita e manda eles se afastarem. Gisela e a velha vao para outro comodo e uhtred aperta seu primo sobre como alfredo espera que ele se mexa e va fazer seu dever contra os dinamarqueses. Ele bate em aldhelm de novo e ameaca aethelred de morte caso machuque aethelflaed de novo. A menina nao \u00e9 amaldicoada e o bispo reconhece a contra gosto que ela esta pura.</p> <p>Aethelred vai com 15 navios atacar Grunkel, o novo lider dinamarques que estava negociando com alfredo. Mas de alguma forma acabaram perdendo 9 navios e a princesa Aethelflaed, raptada pelos homens de sigefrid.</p> <p>Alfredo se reuniu com seu conselho e ficou decidido que Uhtred iria negociar o resgate da rainha da M\u00e9rcia e princesa de Wessex, Aethelflaed, filha do Rei Alfredo.</p> <p>Uhtred vai com staepa e o padre willibald negociar o resgate da princesa. E l\u00e1 ele descobre que ela est\u00e1 apaixonada pelo irm\u00e3o mais novo do earl, Erik. </p> <p>Erik convence Uhtred a ajuda-los a fugir para o norte em direcao \u00e0 dunholm e Ragnar. Mas para isso Uhtred ter\u00e1 que abrir um port\u00e3o navio que bloqueia a passagem dos barcos. Haesten parece suspeitar de algo e Uhtred alerta sobre ele mas Erik descarta. Enquanto isso est\u00e1 tudo acertado sobre o resgate e o ouro deve ser carregado em seguida, ouro suficiente para sigefrid juntar uma horda e assolar wessex. </p> <p>Uhtred, Clapa e Rypere v\u00e3o furtivamente at\u00e9 um dos troncos que prende o barco-port\u00e3o com correntes grossas, mas antes de chegar l\u00e1 percebem um gigantesco incendio no castelo de sigefrid. Subito eles veem homens indo at\u00e9 a corrente e descide mat\u00e1-los, quando percebe que s\u00e3o homens de Haesten, que deve ter ateado fogo no castelo e raptado ele mesmo Aethelflaed, tomando para si o plano de erik. Assim uhtred ajuda seus inimigos a defender a corrente, e n\u00e3o mais a corta-la. Alguns homens de sigefrid saem do navio portao e refor\u00e7am sua defesa mas a parede de escudos \u00e9 curta e os homens s\u00e3o recha\u00e7ados, e a corrente \u00e9 cortada. Uhtred e seus aliados v\u00eaem desolados o navio port\u00e3o ser puxado pela corrente e pela mar\u00e9, enquanto os navios de Haesten se dirigem at\u00e9 o port\u00e3o e a liberdade. Quando tudo parece perdido, o navio de Uhtred, o \u00c1guia do Mar surge e vai de encontro ao navio de Haesten, empurrando-o contra a margem e encalhando-o, formando assim uma nova barreira, com o navio-portao, o \u00c1guia e o navio de Haesten. Ali uma luta desesperada \u00e9 travada, Finan defende o navio de Uhtred enquanto ele e seus homens sobem no navio de Haesten para atacar seus homens. Depois de um tempo surge Erik e seus homens, desesperados para chegar at\u00e9 Aethelflaed, que se encontra num canto com suas aias. Sigefrid vem com seu navio e em velocidade investe contra o Aguia, desestabilizando os homens de Haesten que la lutavam e assim afundando o navio de Uhtred, fazendo todos correrem desesperados para o outro navio. Ralla, o capitao do navio de Uhtred leva seus homens para o navio de Haesten a fim de toma-lo, esse que era chamado de Viajante-Dragao. No viajante eles lutam desesperados e Haesten foge para outro dos seus navios que vinha mais atras. Sigefrid grita triunfante que recuperou \u201ca cadela\u201d Aethelflaed enquanto seu irm\u00e3o exige que ele a entregue a ele. Sigefrid entao percebe a trama e reconhece Uhtred, e Erik tomado por furia svan\u00e7a contra o irm\u00e3o, e cai perfurado pela sua espada. Uhtred mata os homens de sigefrid e manda Osferth, filho bastardo de Alfredo desferir o golpe fatal contra o noruegu\u00eas. E assim ele acaba com os inimigos enquanto resgata a princesa, salvando mais uma vez o reino sax\u00e3o de Alfredo. </p>"},{"location":"lore/cronicas-saxonicas/livro-5-terra-em-chamas/","title":"Livro 5: Terra em Chamas","text":"<p>O livro come\u00e7a com Uhtred pedindo abrigo em um mosteiro, em algum momento no futuro. Ele ent\u00e3o da uma olhada no que os monges estavam copiando e ele se enfurece com a hist\u00f3ria mentirosa que os monges copiavam. Nela o rei da mercia Aethelred ganhava as gl\u00f3rias de batalhas que Uhtred venceu, e por isso ele queimou as paginas. </p> <p>a hist\u00f3ria volta uns anos e come\u00e7a com Uhtred indo se encontrar com Haesten em Scaepig. Haesten estava mais poderoso agora, com 50 navios dinamarqueses e um auto proclamado titulo de Jarl. Uhtred foi enviar os missionarios de alfredo no seu novo navio, o Saelferwulf, lobo de prata. </p> <p>Uhtred estava em casa com Gisela e seus tr\u00eas filhos quando foi convocado por Alfredo para defender Wessex, que queimava. Ele estava indo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos inc\u00eandios causados pelas escaramu\u00e7as com os dinamarqueses de Harald, Cabelo de Sangue, quando avistou um povoado sendo saqueado. Armou uma armadilha pois sabia que eles estavam em busca de cavalos e assim conseguiu capturar Skade, a mulher de Harald. Era uma jovem de 20 anos com olhos azuis e cabelos escuros, com uma beleza assombrosa e fama de feiticeira. Foi capturada e amaldi\u00e7oou Uhtred por isso. </p> <p>Uhtred sabia que Harald tinha pavio curto e assim despiu Skade e a mostrou para as tropas dele, dizendo que ele a havia capturado, e depois disso foi lev\u00e1-la para Alfredo. </p> <p>L\u00e1 com Alfredo ele contou seu plano, e como pretendia levar Harald para Fearnhamme, onde um forte havia sido feito pelos romanos \u00e0s margens do rio. L\u00e1 Uhtred planejava esmagar Harald com um ataque vindo pelos dois lados. O rei assentiu cansado e sem for\u00e7as para discutir, estava velho e doente e planejava deixar seu legado para seu filho mais velho, Eduardo, que se surpreendeu com a beleza de Skade. </p> <p>Harald veio at\u00e9 o forte onde Uhtred estava e exigiu que soltassem Skade, e ao n\u00e3o fazerem ele mandou que 30 mulheres e crian\u00e7as sax\u00e3s fossem enfileiradas, e matou a primeira a machadada, fazendo Uhtred abrir m\u00e3o da feiticeira para evitar uma chacina. Mas isso foi depois que ela jogasse uma maldi\u00e7\u00e3o nele, e assim ele foi receoso para o seu plano. </p> <p>Ele iria atrair Harald para Fearnhamme e l\u00e1 defenderia com a ajuda dos m\u00e9rcios de Aldhelm, amigo de seu primo Aethelred. Com eduardo e staepa nas costas eles iriam esmagar os dinamarqueses, mas isso exigiria que Aldhelm trouxesse as for\u00e7as m\u00e9rcias, algo que Aethelflaed alertou Uhtred que ele pudesse n\u00e3o fazer. Para garantir isso ela disse que iria junto com ele. </p> <p>O plano deu certo e os dinamarqueses foram trucidados. Harald tombou em batalha mas foi salvo pelos seus guerreiros. Skade foi novamente capturada. Ela urra de forma assombrosa e se revira no ch\u00e3o de terra, sussurrando novamente para Uhtred: \u201camaldi\u00e7oado\u201d. </p> <p>Dias depois, de volta no forte com Alfredo e Aethelflaed, Uhtred percebe que seu guarda pessoal Cerdic estava ali, e com ele a not\u00edcia da morte de sua mulher Gisela e o filho que ela estava dando a luz. Uhtred ficou abalado e mesmo assim n\u00e3o fez nada contra Skade, pois mesmo odiando-a sua beleza o paralizava. Ele disse que ela estava livre e que era para ir at\u00e9 o buraco onde Harald lambia suas feridas, mas ela n\u00e3o quis, dizendo que n\u00e3o era seu destino, ela via o futuro e acreditava que seria rainha de Wessex. </p> <p>Haesten devolveu o padre Willibald e disse a ele que sua mulher e filhos queriam ser batizados. Uhtred estava c\u00e9tico, e na cerimonia percebeu que a mulher gorducha do dinamarques n\u00e3o significava nada para ele. Seus planos agora eram ir para Anglia Oriental e ser rei de l\u00e1, Uhtred suspeitava de que ele queria mesmo era a M\u00e9rcia. </p> <p>Na festa de comemora\u00e7\u00e3o do batismo o bispo Godwing come\u00e7ou a berrar e se remexer como se possu\u00eddo, dizendo que a prostituta da babil\u00f4nia estava entre eles, e depois come\u00e7ou a dizer que o nome dela era Gisela. Uhtred foi at\u00e9 ele e deu dois socos na cara dele, um quebrou o maxilar, o outro o pesco\u00e7o, e assim virou inimigo de wessex e teve de fugir. </p> <p>Padre beocca vai ate uhtred e diz que ele deve se render, pedir perd\u00e3o \u00e0 alfredo, entregar skade para seu antigo marido franco Skirnir, e pagar 300 xelins pela morte do agora santo godwing. Mas ao inv\u00e9s disso ele fugiu para o norte levando metade dos seus homens. </p> <p>Pararam em Dumnoc na anglia oriental e l\u00e1 discutiram sobre como levantar ouro suficiente para capturar bebbanburg. Skade tinha ficado com uhtred e jurou n\u00e3o ter amaldi\u00e7oado gisela, e assim os dois acabaram juntos. Agora ela contava sobre Skirnir, da frankia, e de como ele tinha um al\u00e7ap\u00e3o cheio de ouro. </p> <p>Enquanto conversavam sobre o franko na taverna do ganso, sihtric veio correndo alertar Uhtred sobre uma movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de homens armados l\u00e1 fora. Era Guthlic, o reeve da cidade que havia armado para cima de Uhtred. Ele sabia quem era ele e Skade e estava atras da recompensa pela suas cabe\u00e7as. </p> <p>Cercado dentro da taverna uhtred subiu at\u00e9 o segundo andar, onde abriu um buraco no teto e come\u00e7ou a jogar tocos de madeira incendiados nos tetos de palha das tendas vizinhas. Os homens do reeve eram na sua maioria alde\u00f5es locais que largaram tudo para salvar suas casas. Assim os homens de uhtred simplesmente correram para o navio, enquanto uhtred e finan capturavam guthlic. De volta no navio uhtred via a cidade queimar e chutou guthlic ainda amarrado para o mar, explicando para Osferth que n\u00e3o podia deixa-lo viver depois de ele ter o desafiado, pois ele mentiu que iria deixar os homens dele em paz, e isso era uma afronta. </p> <p>Uhtred chega em Dunholm e vai visitar Brida e Ragnar. Brida conta seu plano para capturar o sul de wessex e uhtred diz que pode ajudar mas que vai precisar de muitos homens e prata para isso. No dia seguinte chega Offa, um artista itinerante que usa seu show de cachorros para coletar informa\u00e7\u00f5es e vend\u00ea-las para os outros lordes. </p> <p>Com Offa Uhtred descobriu que Harald recha\u00e7ou um ataque de Aethelred, que Haesten planeja atacar a M\u00e9rcia e que Offa (e consequentemente alfredo) ainda n\u00e3o conhecem o plano de brida de invadir o sul de wessex. Por fim Offa diz que Skirnir estar\u00e1 esperando por ele, pois seu tio iria inform\u00e1-lo. </p> <p>Uhtred encena uma briga entre Osferth e ele, atraindo Skirnir para ir pegar ele e Skade em um barranco de agua. Skirnir acredita na historia de osferth e \u00e9 atraido para a armadilha, sendo morto por Sihtric a pedido de Uhtred, para evitar a crueldade de Skade que estava matando um homem rendido. </p> <p>Depois no castelo de Skirnir viram que o seu tesouro era aumentado por fantasia e que na verdade era desapontador. Skade ficou dizendo que Uhtred tinha prometido metade a ela e assim eles se desentenderam. Foram de volta para Dunholm mais ricos mas nem perto o necessario para pegarem bebbanburg. </p> <p>Uhtred recebe o padre Pyrlig e ele conta como Aethelred enlouqueceu, morre de inveja de Aethelflaed e pretende for\u00e7ar que ela deite com Aldhelm para justificar um div\u00f3rcio, tudo para poderem tomar wessex quando alfredo morrer. A princesa fugiu para um convento e n\u00e3o havia quem a protegesse, por isso Uhtred decidiu largar tudo e ir at\u00e9 ela. </p> <p>L\u00e1 ele encontrou seus filhos e teve um embate com Aldhelm, convencendo seus homens de que ele n\u00e3o era digno, mas sim um covarde. Ele se v\u00ea obrigado a lutar e acaba morrendo para Uhtred, que agora tinha 200 homens dentre seus sax\u00f5es e dinamarqueses. </p> <p>Fuma\u00e7a de inc\u00eandio sobre atr\u00e1s dos homens em marcha, e voltando para l\u00e1 descobrem que Skade, agora parceira de Haesten, tinha invadido e matado a todos, principalmente a abadessa que havia cuidado de Aethelflaed, que agora se encontrava crucificada e pegando fogo. </p> <p>Uhtred e aethelflaed se encontraram com aethelred e discutiram os proximos passos. O rei da mercia queria ficar em wintancaester e esperar os dinamarqueses se chocarem contra suas paredes. J\u00e1 uhtred queria atacar a fortaleza de haesten em beamfleot enquanto ele estava fora saqueando wessex. Mas pra isso ele precisava de homens, e quando tudo parecia perdido eis que surge staepa com 1200 homens. </p> <p>Uhtred est\u00e1 se sentindo desesperan\u00e7oso e sai para cavalgar com uma parte das suas tropas. No meio do caminho avisam que est\u00e3o sendo perseguidos, e que os dinamarqueses est\u00e3o saqueando uma aldeia proxima. Uhtred avan\u00e7a contra eles de forma imprudente e quase mata a todos, mas staepa e eduardo chegam na hora certa e viram as chances da batalha. Na fuga dos dinamarqueses os sax\u00f5es acabam por conseguir entrar no antigo forte e assim conquistam o lugar. Skade estava l\u00e1 mas \u00e9 levada para o novo forte de Beamfleot. </p> <p>O novo forte parece muito mais dif\u00edcil de conquistar, e vai ser necess\u00e1rio atravessar um fosso e subir uma pali\u00e7ada, o que vai requerir a morte de muitos homens bons. </p> <p>Para o fosso Uhtred vai at\u00e9 uma pequena aldeia da anglia oriental e junta velas e treli\u00e7as de barco, para assim criar uma esp\u00e9cie de suporte para os homens tentando subir o barranco lodoso. </p> <p>Ao descansar na fortaleza do lider local, o padre Heahbert(?), Uhtred \u00e9 surpreendido pela qualidade do hidromel, e pede para conhecer o seu criador, um homem atarracado e baixinho lembrando um an\u00e3o chamado Brun, o homem meio insano diz que fala com as abelhas, deixando isso explicito ao pegar uma colmeia na m\u00e3o e cantar hist\u00f3rias de ninar para os insetos que rodeiam seu bra\u00e7o. </p> <p>Uhtred usa as velas nos barrancos, e as abelhas nas muralhas para distrair os dinamarqueses o suficiente para que conseguissem entrar e tomar a fortaleza. Eduardo se mostrou valente e Osferth tamb\u00e9m, curiosamente gritando o nome de seu pai, ao qual se pensava que s\u00f3 guardava rancor. No fim a fortaleza foi tomada e Skade morta por Harald no sal\u00e3o principal do castelo onde os tesouros de Haesten eram amontoados. </p>"},{"location":"lore/dragonlance/livro-1-dragoes-outono/","title":"Drag\u00f5es do Crep\u00fasculo do Outono","text":"<p>Tanis, um meio-elfo ranger, flint, um an\u00e3o guerreiro e Taslehof, um kender ladino se reunem em Consola\u00e7\u00e3o, na hospedaria do lar derradeiro para se reencontrarem com os gemeos caramon e raistin. Caramon eh um gigante guerreiro e raistin um mago franzino que recebeu uma estranha afli\u00e7\u00e3o poderosa que deixou seus olhos dourados como ampulhetas e sua pele com manchas vermelhas.  </p> <p>O combinado era se encontrarem depois de cinco anos para reportarem o que descobriram sobre a fonte do mal que assola o mundo.  </p> <p>Os deuses sumiram e as trevas tomaram conta da Era do Desespero.</p> <p>Tanis estava triste pois Kitiara mandou uma carta dizendo que n\u00e3o vinha, tinha compromissos com seu novo lorde. Sturm entrou logo depois, era um cavaleiro solamniano da ordem da rosa. Ele deu passagem para um casal de barbaros, um homem alto de quase dois metros, e uma mulher esbelta com cabelo prata-dourado. Eles se sentaram perto de um velho que contava hist\u00f3rias para uma crian\u00e7a. Hist\u00f3rias dos deuses antigos, hoje blasfemos, pois acreditavam que os deuses eram a causa do cataclismo. O perscrutador Hedeker ouvia tudo em um canto, e acusou o velho e o casal de barbaros de blasfemia. Pois a mulher tinha cantado uma musica sobre ser filha do lider da tribo, que se apaixonou por um pobre, e que o lider tinha dado uma miss\u00e3o impossivel para o jovem, de ir encontrar um sinal dos deuses. Ele retornou com um cajado de cristal mas foi desconsiderado e apedrejado para fora da tribo, mas a filha do lider foi junto.  </p> <p>O barbaro empurra o perscrutador que gritava com eles, e o homem acaba por cair na lareira, ele sai com a cara em chamas, e o velho sugere para Tas que derrube o homem com o cajado da mulher afim de apagarem o fogo quando ele caisse. Mas quando o kender acerta o homem com o cajado e ele cai, as chamas se apagam e o rosto do homem \u00e9 curado. Uma magia de cura havia muito tempo n\u00e3o era vista.  </p> <p>O cajado de cristal azul era procurado por todos da cidade, sendo prometido a morte para quem n\u00e3o o entregasse \u00e0s autoridades.

Cai uma chuva forte vinda do norte, inesperada e preocupante para Tanis, que conhece os padr\u00f5es da natureza. Decidem ir para Ref\u00fagio mostrar o cajado para os Perscrutadores de l\u00e1, na esperan\u00e7a de serem do bem.</p> <p>O grupo atravessa a floresta do vale de consola\u00e7\u00e3o, ao sair para a estrada se deparam com cl\u00e9rigos estranhos. O grupo se esconde e sturm os intercepta. Os cl\u00e9rigos falam com uma voz sussurrada, e em uma lingua gutural. Eles dizem que est\u00e3o procurando o cajado de cristal azul para curar um companheiro deles, e Lua Dourada sai do esconderijo para lhes entregar o cajado</p> <p>Quando lua dourada chega perto do clerigo ferido, descobre que ele \u00e9 uma especie de reptil humanoide, e ele avan\u00e7a agarrando o cajado mas cai morto e queimado. Sturm apunhala um deles com a espada e ela fica presa nas suas costas, pois a criatura virou pedra. Eles conseguem fugir para a floresta sombria, e sturm come\u00e7a a ter vis\u00f5es de um cervo branco que parece gui\u00e1-lo por trilhas esquecidas e antigas.</p> <p>O grupo segue sturm e sua vis\u00e3o do cervo at\u00e9 uma clareira. L\u00e1 eles se deparam com fantasmas guerreiros, e Raistlin faz uma ponte entre eles. Conversando com os esp\u00edritos falam sobre o cajado de cristal azul, e ao comentar sobre isso os espiritos os deixam em paz. Mas centauros logo aparecem e os levam galopando para dentro da floresta sombria. L\u00e1 eles se encontram com a Mestre da Floresta, uma unic\u00f3rnio que lhes d\u00e1 um banquete e um lugar para descansarem. Ela diz que teve uma vis\u00e3o e que deveria guiar a portadora do cajado para a cidade de Xak Tsaroth. Raistlin diz que a cidade foi abandonada no cataclismo, e que antes disso era um local de venera\u00e7\u00e3o aos deuses antigos. Raistlin pergunta sobre as criaturas reptilianas e a Mestre diz que eles se chamam de draconianos, filhos de Draco. E um exercito deles est\u00e1 se formando no norte para dominar toda terra de Ansalon.</p> <p>O grupo \u00e9 levado por pegasos at\u00e9 uma plan\u00edcie do leste. O lider deles diz que n\u00e3o pode leva los mais adiante, devido a algum mal que se avizinha. Eles veem fuma\u00e7a subindo do leste e v\u00e3o at\u00e9 Que-Shu, a vila da tribo dos barbaros. L\u00e1 encontram toda a cidade derretida, e dois hobgoblins pendurados como um aviso para n\u00e3o fazerem prisioneiros sem que Verminaard tenha ordenado.  </p> <p>Seguindo al\u00e9m da vila queimada o grupo entra em um p\u00e2ntano, sendo emboscados por draconianos magos que os capturam.</p> <p>O grupo chega \u00e0s ru\u00ednas de um templo, com um po\u00e7o na sua frente. Chegando l\u00e1 v\u00eaem um draconiano pular para dentro do po\u00e7o, e logo em seguida ele ruir com a subida de uma dragoa negra. Ela ataca com uma baforada de \u00e1cido que corroi vento ligeiro. Depois da dragoa se dar por satisfeita e voltar para o buraco do po\u00e7o o grupo se reune no templo onde lua dourada estava. L\u00e1 eles encontram uma estatua de Mishak, a deusa da cura. Ela aben\u00e7oa o cajado de cristal e a usa para curar vento ligeiro. A deusa diz a miss\u00e3o de lua dourada: descer at\u00e9 as ru\u00ednas de Xak Tsaroth e recuperar os discos de Mishak. Ela conta que na verdade n\u00e3o foram os deuses que abandonaram os homens, mas o contr\u00e1rio, e que agora h\u00e1 uma luta entre os do bem e os do mal, com a deusa das trevas tentando voltar ao mundo material.  </p> <p>Eles seguem para o leste do templo e descem uma escadaria para as criptas de xak tsaroth. L\u00e1 se encontram com os an\u00f5es tolos, uma ra\u00e7a inferior de an\u00f5es que moravam ali e foram subjugados pelos draconianos. Raistlin os encanta com um feiti\u00e7o de amizade e pede sua ajuda para surpreender os draconianos, que esperam pelos an\u00f5es em uma especie de elevador improvisado com um grande balde.</p> <p>O grupo ia descer os potes de ferro mas uma tropa de draconianos estava subindo. Eles lutaram e conseguiram fugir por uma passagem secreta que a lider dos anoes tolos, Bupu, abriu para eles.</p> <p>O grupo encontra o rei caudo altobulpe I, e ele diz saber um caminho secreto at\u00e9 o covil da dragoa, onde os discos da deusa Mishkal est\u00e3o. Eles tra\u00e7am um plano mas ele \u00e9 frustrado pois o rei contou para a dragoa. Ent\u00e3o lua dourada se sacrifica para atacar com o cajado, queimando a dragoa e seu corpo. Eles pegam os discos e fogem da cidade de xak tsaroth que est\u00e1 desmoronando. Ao chegar la em cima encontram lua dourada de novo, agora como uma verdadeira cl\u00e9riga com poderes de cura. O objetivo dela \u00e9 encontrar um l\u00edder capaz de unir os povos contra Lorde Verminaard, o cl\u00e9rigo do mal e mestre dos drag\u00f5es. Eles escutam trombetas do norte e fogem para o oeste, at\u00e9 o cume de uma montanha. L\u00e1 eles descansam e, ao olhar para o oeste v\u00eaem Consola\u00e7\u00e3o queimando.</p> <p>Tika conta ao grupo o que houve com a cidade. O exercito do lorde verminaard desceu do norte com cinco dragoes vermelhos que incendiaram toda a cidade, tirando a hospedaria, o armazem e a forja. O grupo discute onde vao em seguida, e tanis diz querer ir para qualinost, as terras elficas. Um homem de capuz se dirige at\u00e9 eles, e \u00e9 um elfo antigo conhecido de tanis. Os draconianos interrompem o encontro e uma briga estoura na hospedaria. O grupo \u00e9 capturado.</p> <p>O grupo vai dentro de uma jaula em dire\u00e7\u00e3o sul at\u00e9 pax tharmas, as minas do lorde verminaard. Um velho aparece xingando uma arvore e \u00e9 capturado, raistlin o reconhece como um magi. Ele diz se chamar fizbain. Tanis se lembra da sua historia com o elfo capturado, de como cresceram juntos, mas foram afastados diante da crescente atra\u00e7\u00e3o entre tanis e a irm\u00e3 do elfo. Theros, o ferreiro de consola\u00e7\u00e3o aparece na jaula sem um bra\u00e7o, e Gilthanas conta como ele estava ajudando os elfos a fugir do genoc\u00eddio perpetrado por verminaard.  </p> <p>Os elfos de Qualinost atacam as caravanas e salvam os companheiros, mas agora s\u00e3o presos por eles para explicarem o que \u00e9 a estranha magia de cura expressa pelas ora\u00e7\u00f5es de lua dourada.</p> <p>O grupo chega na cidade \u00e9lfica de Qualinost, e vai ter com o l\u00edder dos elfos, o Orador do Sol. L\u00e1 Gilthanas reporta para seu pai o que aconteceu com ele, sobre como o ataque \u00e0 Pax Tharkas fracassou, e como os seus companheiros capturados foram mortos pelo Lorde Verminaard, que montava um drag\u00e3o vermelho.  </p> <p>Lua Dourada mostra seu pingente da deusa e uma confus\u00e3o come\u00e7a, mas o velho mago Fizban controla a situa\u00e7\u00e3o e chama o Orador pelo seu nome secreto.</p> <p>O grupo parte de Qualinost acompanhados por Gilthanas at\u00e9 o Sla Mori, uma rota secreta para Pax Tharkas. Eles encontram uma clareira onde uma batalha recente deixou corpos de goblins e homens no ch\u00e3o. Embaixo de dois hobgoblins um gemido foi ouvido, onde um homem chamado Eben estava deitado. Uma d\u00fazia de draconianos surgem nas margens da clareira e atacam o grupo. Tika, agora vestida com armadura, espada e escudo, tenta lutar mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito boa, mesmo assim matando dois draconianos com seu escudo</p> <p>O grupo entra em um tumulo secreto de um antigo rei elfico. L\u00e1 eles se deparam com uma lesma gigante que quase os mata, sendo salvos por acaso pela espada encantada que, de acordo com Tanis, o pr\u00f3prio rei esqueleto p\u00f4s em sua m\u00e3o. Laurana aparece dizendo que vai ir com eles porque ama Tanis e vai faz\u00ea-lo orgulhoso dela.</p> <p>O grupo avan\u00e7a e passa por uma sala com os espiritos da guarda do rei, que deixam eles passarem quando veem o colar de Mishakal. Depois acham a sala do tesouro, que \u00e9 protegida pelo espirito de uma drow. Eles fogem e finalmente chegam em pax tharkas.</p> <p>Ao fugir da drow, Tas e Fizban subiram por uma enorme corrente de ferro. Eles escalaram toda ela e seguiram pelo tunel que a levava, at\u00e9 encontrarem um buraco com luz saindo da parede. L\u00e1 eles viram a sala do trono de lorde verminaard. E l\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m viram o drag\u00e3o Ardor, ou Pyros. Dois prisioneiros foram apresentados ao lorde, um deles era o an\u00e3o tolo que ajudou o grupo a escapar da gaiola em consola\u00e7\u00e3o. O outro era um humano mudo e surdo, que instigou o interesse de pyros mas que n\u00e3o significava nada para verminaard. Isso porque Pyros tem uma miss\u00e3o secreta de achar o homem chamado Berem, O Eterno.  </p> <p>Logo depois um draconiano chega dizendo a Pyros que o traidor teve sucesso e que a cl\u00e9rigs foi capturada, mas Pyros diz para n\u00e3o avisar verminaard, pois ele tem um plano.</p> <p>O grupo se reune com as mulheres aprisionadas e conta seus planos. V\u00e3o se vestir de mulheres e ir at\u00e9 os homens entregar-lhes o jantar, assim libertando-os. As crian\u00e7as s\u00e3o guardadas por um drag\u00e3o velho e louco que acha que elas s\u00e3o suas crias, e n\u00e3o parece ser um problema resgata las quando ela estiver dormindo.  </p> <p>Tas e Fizban encontram uma sala com ponturas antigas e descobrem uma com dragoes atacando pax tharkas enquanto cavaleiros de solamnia os combatem montados em dragoes bondosos, um deles portando a lanca do dragao: a lendaria arma usada pelo heroi Huma para combater a deusa das trevas.</p> <p>Tanis planeja com as mulheres e percebe que Raistlin, Gilthanas e Eben sumiram por alguns instantes, o que significa que um deles \u00e9 um traidor, e que verminaard provavelmente sabe seus planos, mas mesmo assim eles devem seguir.  </p> <p>Tas e Fizban observam o covil de Pyros enquanto ele recebe a visita do traidor encapuzado. Ele diz o plano de Tanis e que ia contar para Verminaard. Mas o drag\u00e3o diz que ele n\u00e3o deve contar, que deve aproveitar a confus\u00e3o para resgatar O Eterno, Berem, o homem que deve ser levado vivo at\u00e9 a deusa das trevas.  </p> <p>Sestun, o an\u00e3o tolo que virou amigo de Tas e ajudou na sua fuga de consola\u00e7\u00e3o foi jogado no covil, mas o dragao se recusou a come-lo. Tas e Fizban o resgatam usando uma magia de levita\u00e7\u00e3o do mago, mas o seu chapeu acaba caindo no meio deles e o dragao percebe que eles devem ter ouvido seu segredo sobre o homem da joia verde, Berem. Ele ent\u00e3o parte atr\u00e1s deles, e quando eles chegam nas correntes, o drag\u00e3o queima uma haste e a destrava, fazendo os tr\u00eas despencarem. O mago consegue lan\u00e7ar uma magia de penas que salva tas e sestun, mas n\u00e3o antes dele mesmo se espatifar no ch\u00e3o.  </p> <p>Tanis e o grupo resgatam as crian\u00e7as, mas acabam despertando a loucura da dragoa anci\u00e3 e senil Matafleur. A dragoa viu as crian\u00e7as como suas pr\u00f3prias crias irem embora, e ao ver a espada m\u00e1gica de Tanis ressoar amea\u00e7adoramente decide ataca-los. Eles fogem mas ela continua berrando insanamente.</p> <p>Eben manda os homens para o patio reencontrar suas mulheres, contrariando o plano de tanis afim de encontrar Berem e levalo dali. Ele ebcontra o homem e diz ser seu amigo, e que vai leva lo para a floresta em seguran\u00e7a. Na confus\u00e3o no p\u00e1tio surge verminaard montando pyros, prestes a matar a todos queimados quando matafleur surge atacando o dragao vermelho. Isso tira o choque dos prisioneiros e eles se organizam para fugir para as montanhas. Verminaard manda chamarem de volta seus exercitos e parte para atacar o grupo.</p> <p>Verminaard luta contra sturm, tanis e caramon, e quase derrota todos eles usando os milagres da deusa das trevas, mas lua dourada segura o bra\u00e7o dele, e a deusa se apavora com a visao do deus maior que brilha acima dela, e foge, deixando seu cl\u00e9rigo \u00e0 morte. O dragao pyros estava derretendo a dragoa anci\u00e3 matafleur, mas ela usa seu proprio corpo para esmagar o dragao contra a parede de uma montanha, espatifando ambos.  </p> <p>O povo foge de pax tharkas enquanto os anoes tolos defendem a fortaleza contra a subida dos exercitos draconianos, e no fim lua dourada e vento ligeiro se casam sob a ben\u00e7\u00e3o de Elistan, um alto perscrutador de Ref\u00fagio que foi salvo pela cl\u00e9riga e que agora se volta ao estudo dos deuses antigos.</p>"},{"location":"lore/drizzt/l1-patria/","title":"Volume 1 - P\u00e1tria","text":"<p>O prel\u00fadio \u00e9 uma introdu\u00e7\u00e3o ao mundo subterr\u00e2neo e a sua cidade Menzoberranzan, dos elfos negros chamados Drow.

A casa Do\u2019Urden est\u00e1 planejando um ataque \u00e0 casa DeVir, pois a mesma caiu em desgra\u00e7a aos olhos de Lolth, a Rainha Aranha. A sociedade Drow \u00e9 matriarcal, e a matriarca \u00e9 sempre uma mulher sacerdotisa de Lolth. Matriarca Malicia era a lider dos Do\u2019Urden, da decima primeira casa de nobres. Os Drow possuem poderes raciais que o tornam capazes de levitar e possuir vis\u00e3o infravermelha, al\u00e9m de ler pensamentos no caso das sacerdotisas.</p> <p>Dinin \u00e9 o segundo filho homem vivo da casa Do\u2019Urden, e lidera o ex\u00e9rcito furtivo contra a fortaleza DeVir. Seu pai Rizzen era o atual Patriarca e comandava a outra parte das tropas Drow, enquanto o primog\u00eanito da Matriarca Malicia, Nalfein, ia pelos fundos com a sua tropa de feiticeiros. A deusa aranha Lolth estava com eles e a luta acabou em instantes, enquanto isso, o mestre de armas e antigo patriarca Zaknafein se infiltrava pelo teto da fortaleza, camuflado por um feiti\u00e7o de frio que Briza havia conjurado. Zak foi encarregado de encontrar a ante-sala onde Matriarca Ginafae DeVir se encontrava com as suas filhas, em um combate mental contra as sacerdotisas dos Do\u2019Urden. Malicia estava com suas filhas lutando mentalmente com as DeVir enquanto dava \u00e0 luz ao seu terceiro filho homem, e usou o poder da dor do parto para um poderoso golpe mental que abalou todas as sacerdotisas da casa DeVir. Zak ent\u00e3o se aproveitou para invadir o aposento e mat\u00e1-las enquanto estavam atordoadas. Ele sente uma conjura\u00e7\u00e3o vindo de uma delas e arranca a l\u00edngua de Ginafae com o seu chicote. O terceiro filho homem deve ser sacrificado para Lolth, mas n\u00e3o antes de ser nomeado. O nome dele seria Drizzt, e assim que a primog\u00eanita Brisa ia apunhal\u00e1-lo, sua irm\u00e3 Vierna avisa que Nalfein est\u00e1 morto, e que Drizzt n\u00e3o \u00e9 mais o terceiro filho vivo. Ela s\u00f3 omite que Dinin foi o respons\u00e1vel, apunhalando seu irm\u00e3o pelas costas e assim se tornando o filho mais velho dos Do\u2019Urden.</p> <p>Dinin, antes da casa Do'Urden lan\u00e7ar a sua investida, negociou um assassinato com o mestre da escola de magia, o Sem Rosto. Um dos filhos dos DeVir, Alton, \u00e9 estudante da Academia e deveria ser assassinado para que a sua casa por fim fosse erradicada. Por\u00e9m, o mestre com o rosto desfigurado n\u00e3o contava com o \u00f3dio de seu aprendiz Masoj, que aproveitou o momento do confronto entre mestre e aprendiz para furtar uma besta envenenada e assim matar aquele que o tratava com tanto desd\u00e9m. Por fim, antes de ser morto tamb\u00e9m pelas m\u00e3os do servi\u00e7al Masoj, Alton consegue convenc\u00ea-lo a poupa-lo, trocando sua vida pela de Sem Rosto para que assim Alton conseguisse vingan\u00e7a contra aqueles que mataram sua fam\u00edlia. Com isso Masoj poderia ter um nome de destaque na Academia e n\u00e3o mais ser desprezado nem tratado como um servi\u00e7al. Masoj por fim pega uma po\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido do antigo Sem Rosto e se aproxima de Alton, que em um primeiro momento se op\u00f5e, mas depois aceita ao ser tomado pelo esp\u00edrito da Vingan\u00e7a.</p> <p>Matriarca Mal\u00edcia \u00e9 convidada pela casa Baenre, a primeira casa de Menzoberranzan.

Como tal, deve come\u00e7ar a treinar suas especialidades. Ele deveria ser treinado por Rizzen nas artes da magia, por\u00e9m se mostrou apto \u00e0 guerra ao ser testado pelo mestre de armas Zaknafein. O garoto \u00e9 ambidestro e extremamente \u00e1gil, al\u00e9m de inteligente. Zak est\u00e1 convencido de que ele \u00e9 seu filho, e n\u00e3o de Rizzen, e que ele \u00e9 diferente dos outros, ainda com uma imaculada ingenuidade infantil, prestes a ser quebrada pelo sombrio mundo dos drow. Zak torce para que ele seja diferente, e se pega sonhando com o massacre ao povo DeVir.</p> <p>Alton o Sem Rosto continua sua busca pelo nome da casa que dizimou a sua. Ele agora tenta contato com um esp\u00edrito do mundo inferior, sua m\u00e3e, Matriarca Ginafae. Ele entoa o feiti\u00e7o e consegue materializar sua m\u00e3e na fuma\u00e7a da vela a sua frente. Por\u00e9m antes de conseguir uma resposta uma aia de Lolth, um ser chamado yochlol surge e repreende o mago por tentar contactar um ser do Abismo que caiu nas desgra\u00e7as da Rainha Aranha. Ele s\u00f3 sobrevive ao conjurar uma bola de fogo em seus p\u00e9s, para assim se livrar da inunda\u00e7\u00e3o de aranhas que o esp\u00edrito vomitou sobre ele.</p> <p>Zak e Drizzt treinam o combate corpo-a-corpo. O jovem demonstrou uma per\u00edcia elevada e uma carisma diferente. Ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 como os outros drow, assim como Zak tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o o \u00e9. Drizzt ainda \u00e9 puro e compartilha com Zak uma vis\u00e3o de mundo menos mal\u00e9fica e ca\u00f3tica, por\u00e9m sua m\u00e3e tem planos para moldar o garoto conforme a frieza e crueldade dos drow. Zak se v\u00ea impotente quanto a isso mas far\u00e1 de tudo para preservar esse lado bom de Drizzt.</p> <p>Drizzt \u00e9 acordado por Zak para presenciar um espet\u00e1culo na varanda de sua casa. Clar\u00f5es e chamas iluminam na dist\u00e2ncia, onde duas fam\u00edlias de nobres estavam se digladiando. No dia seguinte vem a convoca\u00e7\u00e3o, os atacantes falharam e dever\u00e3o sofrer a justi\u00e7a drow. Todos os nobres s\u00e3o reunidos em frente \u00e0 fortaleza da fam\u00edlia, agora em desgra\u00e7a, e assistem ao massacre performado pelos membros das tr\u00eas escolas da Academia, os magos, guerreiros e as sacerdotisas atacam a casa. Magos soltam rel\u00e2mpagos, nuvens de \u00e1cido e bolas de fogo, as sacerdotisas convocam seres monstruosos dos planos inferiores, enquanto os guerreiros disparam virotes contra qualquer poss\u00edvel sa\u00edda do complexo. Drizzt volta para casa completamente confuso e apavorado, sem nem perceber a arte drow daquelas ruas que nunca tinha visto antes</p> <p>Drizzt tem sua inoc\u00eancia roubada ao ser obrigado pela sua m\u00e3e a assassinar um drow. Ela pretende envi\u00e1-lo \u00e0 Academia, mesmo perante os protestos de seu mestre de armas, Zak.</p> <p>Drizzt tem um \u00faltimo embate emotivo com Zak, que se despede do garoto ing\u00eanuo e sorridente que est\u00e1 prestes a virar um guerreiro. Alton Hunet estuda a fortaleza Devir de cima de um cogumelo, saboreando seu \u00f3dio e sede por vingan\u00e7a.</p> <p>Drizzt entra na academia de guerreiros e se destaca como o melhor espadachim. Seu irm\u00e3o Dinin est\u00e1 em conflito entre o orgulho, a inveja e o medo de ser superado. Drizzt \u00e9 inundado desde o primeiro dia com uma ret\u00f3rica fascista de \u00f3dio aos seres da superf\u00edcie, e de louvor \u00e0 Rainha Aranha, Lolth. Drizzt faz de tudo para bloquear a corrup\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3dio, trai\u00e7\u00e3o e fome de poder doutrinado pelos mestres.</p> <p>Os aprendizes guerreiros saem em patrulha para fora dos limites da cidade, e se deparam com Ganchadores que raptaram uma princesa drow da casa Baenre, a primeira casa dos nobres. Drizzt persegue imprudentemente as criaturas e consegue derrotar duas delas sozinho, por\u00e9m isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 o suficiente para impedir os monstros de assassinar a crian\u00e7a drow. Drizzt \u00e9 tomado pela f\u00faria e age inconsequentemente, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 repreendido devido \u00e0 sua excepcional per\u00edcia em combate. Depois os guerreiros percebem que a crian\u00e7a na verdade \u00e9 um garoto, e de uma casa menor, o que \u00e9 visto como al\u00edvio e esc\u00e1rnio pelos outros guerreiros, mas para Drizzt apenas a indigna\u00e7\u00e3o aparece, ao perceber que a situa\u00e7\u00e3o foi planejada pelos mestres.</p> <p>Drizzt est\u00e1 no seu \u00faltimo ano na Academia. Ele passou os primeiros 6 meses na escola de magia, aprendendo com Masoj Hunet, o aprendiz de Alton Sem Rosto. Drizzt fica maravilhado com a pantera m\u00e1gica que Masoj possui, e \u00e9 atacado por Alton em um s\u00fabito surto de vingan\u00e7a. Depois, passa o resto dos seus dias na Academia na companhia das sacerdotisas de Lolth. Na cerim\u00f4nia de gradua\u00e7\u00e3o, Drizzt e os outros guerreiros participam de um ritual onde as sacerdotisas invocam um ser dos planos inferiores para se deitar com a melhor aluna da escola de sacerdotisas. Tudo isso enquanto incensos entorpecentes s\u00e3o queimados, e as outras sacerdotisas se deitam com os guerreiros. Drizzt n\u00e3o aguenta toda aquela confus\u00e3o e sai da sala, apenas para se deparar com sua irm\u00e3 Vierna. Ela manda ele voltar e ele explode em raiva, maldizendo o nome da Rainha Aranha. Tal sacril\u00e9gio n\u00e3o pode ficar impune, e Vierna leva o jovem guerreiro para um desfiladeiro no limite da cidade, onde seres meio drow e meio aranha vivem sob a maldi\u00e7\u00e3o de Lolth. Drizzt \u00e9 salvo da morte por sua m\u00e3e, que promete transform\u00e1-lo em uma daquelas criaturas caso ele volte a cometer aquele sacril\u00e9gio.</p> <p>Drizzt se forma na Academia e volta para casa. L\u00e1 \u00e9 convocado com toda sua familia para receber not\u00edcias de conspira\u00e7\u00e3o contra sua casa. Ele em seguida sai para patrulhar junto de Masoj e da sua pantera Guenhwyvar, cada vez mais pr\u00f3xima de Drizzt, e de seu irm\u00e3o Dinin. Zak est\u00e1 esperan\u00e7oso que a Academia n\u00e3o quebrou seu filho ambidestro.</p> <p>Matriarca Synafae Hunet acusa casa DoUrden do assassinato dos DeVir. Pede que as outras casas desviem o olhar enquanto Hunett busca vingan\u00e7a. As outras casas aceitam, vendo vantagem independente do resultado.</p> <p>Drizzt e sua equipe, liderada por Dinin recebem a miss\u00e3o de ir para a superf\u00edcie atacar os malvados elfos. Masoj diz que n\u00e3o quer ir, e Drizzt lamenta a aus\u00eancia de sua amiga pantera.</p> <p>O ataque na superf\u00edcie demonstrou o horror dos drow sobre os seus primos elfos. Drizzt se maravilhou com a floresta, a luz e os cantigos elficos. N\u00e3o foi capaz de participar do massacre, e se deleitou at\u00e9 ficar tonto com a luz quente do sol nascente.</p> <p>Drizzt \u00e9 mandado para patrulhar novamente, Masoj recebe a ordem de assassin\u00e1-lo.</p> <p>Os drow encontram um grupo de gnomos minerando uma caverna. O ataque \u00e9 liderado por Drizzt, que luta contra um elemental de terra e \u00e9 capturado pelos gnomos.</p> <p>Drizzt \u00e9 capturado pelos gnomos das profundezas e se surpreende com a boa \u00edndole dos mesmos. Eles n\u00e3o torturam e n\u00e3o fazem escravos, algo que provocou curiosidade e interesse da parte de drizzt. Os drow resgatam o jovem espadachim, massacrando os gnomos em seu caminho. Drizzt consegue convencer de pouparem o lider, Belwar, mas n\u00e3o antes de cortarem suas duas m\u00e3os.</p> <p>Matriarca Malicia fala com uma yochlol, uma aia de lolth, sobre a familia que planeja atacar os do urden. Drizzt se lembra do raio direcionado a si e agora embate zaknafei sobre jogo, direito, lazer e em casa.</p> <p>Drizzt retorna e tem um embate mortal com seu mestre de armas, zaknafein. Depois de trocarem insultos e acusa\u00e7\u00f5es, drizzt confessa n\u00e3o ter matado a crian\u00e7a elfo, o que enche Zak de orgulho e esperan\u00e7a. Por\u00e9m, Matriarca Mal\u00edcia tinha sido informada pela yoclol de que algu\u00e9m havia desagradado Lolth, e ela espiona esse confronto entre pai e filho. Drizzt sai de casa para clarear seus pensamentos e vaga pelo Subterr\u00e2neo, sendo pego por um monstro carangueijo/aranha chamado pescador. Ele \u00e9 salvo pela pantera astral Guenhwivar, que foi comandada para mat\u00e1-lo, por\u00e9m resiste ao comando e se conecta com Drizzt. Ele decide ent\u00e3o matar Masoj para libertar sua companheira felina.</p> <p>Zaknafein \u00e9 pego pelas sacerdotisas Do\u2019Urden, e descobre que elas haviam ouvido tudo, e que precisam matar Drizzt para voltar \u00e0s gra\u00e7as de Lolth. Zak ent\u00e3o se sacrifica no lugar. Enquanto isso Drizzt e Guenhwyvar entram em combate contra Masoj e Anton Sem Rosto. Anton tem uma varinha m\u00e1gica dada a ele por matriarca Hunet, mas ao usar uma vez a varinha se quebra e explode numa grande bola de fogo. Drizzt mata Masoj, mas n\u00e3o antes de sofrer danos cr\u00edticos, com bra\u00e7o e m\u00e3o quebrados, se movendo apenas pela for\u00e7a do seu \u00f3dio contra aqueles que talvez tenham matado sua amiga pantera.</p> <p>Drizzt retorna para casa e descobre que Zak foi sacrificado para aplacar a f\u00faria da Rainha Aranha.

O grupo consegue botar os gigantes para correr, e ao reconhecerem o vulto de drizzt os ajudando decidem desistir da persegui\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo com Roddy ainda teimosamente querendo ca\u00e7\u00e1-lo.</p> <p>Drizzt est\u00e1 no estreito do orc morto e l\u00e1 \u00e9 vigiado tanto pelos elfos parentes de Kellendil, como pelos pr\u00f3prios orques. Drizzt est\u00e1 aprendendo a lidar com as esta\u00e7\u00f5es e a chegada do inverno, com um frio nunca visto por ele no Subterr\u00e2neo.</p> <p>Mont\u00f3lio \u00e9 um ranger anci\u00e3o e cego que decidiu viver o resto da sua vida em reclus\u00e3o no vale, junto com seus amigos animais. Ele vigia o drow tamb\u00e9m e fica feliz por perceber que ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 aliado de Graul, o lider dos orques.</p> <p>Drizzt quase se desespera com o frio do inverno mas usando areia para marcar o tempo entende como funciona as esta\u00e7\u00f5es e isso lhe d\u00e1 for\u00e7as. Ele acha uma caverna com um grande urso marrom e um estranho fen\u00f4meno acontece entre os dois, que se entendem e convivem em harmonia na mesma caverna. Mont\u00f3lio ouve com espanto de sua coruja Piante sobre como o estranho drow est\u00e1 dividindo uma caverna com Algazarra, o urso.</p> <p>Depois de passar o inverno o urso acorda e drizzt decide que \u00e9 hora de seguir viagem, decide explorar o outro lado do rio e acaba vagando nas terras de Graul, o rei orque. Ele entra em combate com dois pelot\u00f5es que o perseguem e \u00e9 salvo por Mont\u00f3lio e sua coruja, que guia os tiros do ranger cego a partir dos seus piados.</p> <p>Mont\u00f3lio fala em goblin com drizzt e se conecta com guenhwyvar usando algum feiti\u00e7o, fazendo a felina relaxar e convencer drizzt a ir com Mont\u00f3lio para sua casa. A primeira coisa que mont\u00f3lio quer \u00e9 ensinar a lingua comum a drizzt.</p> <p>Os elfos se surpreendem por drizzt estar junto de mont\u00f3lio e decidem deixar eles em paz. O sprite est\u00e1 aliado a um lobo invernal e relata para ele sobre os movimentos do drow. Montolio e drizzt se tornam amigos e montolio ensina a lingua comum e mais diversos conhecimentos sobre a vida da superf\u00edcie e os segredos dos rangers.</p> <p>Drizzt conta sua hist\u00f3ria para Mont\u00f3lio, que ouve com assombro sobre a sociedade drow de Menzoberranzan. Mont\u00f3lio tamb\u00e9m conta a sua hist\u00f3ria, de como foi instru\u00eddo nos caminhos da deusa Mieliki, que tem os orcs como inimigos favorito e que perdeu a vis\u00e3o para as chamas de um drag\u00e3o vermelho.</p> <p>Num certo dia Drizzt acorda com Roddy falando com Mont\u00f3lio, indagando sobre um drow. Mont\u00f3lio mente sobre Drizzt, mas ao ir embora o c\u00e9lere Tephanis surge perante o ca\u00e7ador de recompensas e mostra como Mont\u00f3lio mentiu. Roddy decide ent\u00e3o ir ver com seus companheiros orcs e o rei Graul para fazer com que eles ataquem os dois.</p> <p>Tephanis e seu aliado Caroak, um lobo invernal prateado est\u00e3o ansiosos para se livrarem do ranger anci\u00e3o e do elfo negro.</p> <p>Com Piante o velho ranger sabe dos movimentos dos orcs, e ele esperava por esse momento faz muito tempo. Prepara ent\u00e3o todo o seu bosque com as mais diversas armadilhas.</p> <p>Os orcs vieram pelo oeste e foram caindo perante as armadilhas da dupla, no sul os worgs de Caroak foram recebidos por Guenhwivar que conseguiu usar o bafo de gelo do lobo invernal contra sua pr\u00f3pria matilha, e depois terminou o servi\u00e7o torcendo o pesco\u00e7o do seu inimigo.</p> <p>Kellindil e seus companheiros ajudaram a pantera varando os worgs com flechas. Drizzt lan\u00e7ou seu c\u00edrculo de escurid\u00e3o ao redor do escudo do ranger cego e ele usou esse globo ambulante para confundir os orcs e mat\u00e1-los. Do outro lado Algazarra e seus amigos ursos faziam a festa estra\u00e7alhando dezenas de orcs em desespero. S\u00f3 restou a Graul e Roddy fugirem.</p> <p>Mas Kellindil suspeitava de algo e capturou Roddy, pretendendo lev\u00e1-lo \u00e0 Columba Garra de Falc\u00e3o em Maldobar. Mas antes disso o sprite Tephanis soltou o bruto ca\u00e7ador e assim ele assassinou o nobre elfo. Ainda com sede de vingan\u00e7a o humano queria voltar para pegar o drow, mas foi persuadido por Tephanis a abandonar esse plano, ent\u00e3o juntos foram para o oeste.</p> <p>Os dias se passaram e Drizzt continuava aprendendo os caminhos dos rangers com Monshi, o apelido caridoso de Mont\u00f3lio Debrouche\u00e9. Mas o anci\u00e3o estava cada vez mais sentindo o peso da idade e pediu para Drizzt prometer a ele que sairia e conheceria o mundo quando o velho se fosse. Pois o mundo \u00e9 grande e cheio de dor, mas tamb\u00e9m cheio de felicidades.</p> <p>Drizzt partiu com a companhia dos Frades Penitentes em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a Mirabar. Esse grupo de mendigos acreditava que o sofrimento era finito, e assim se submetiam a sofrer para o bem de todos, em troca de alguma doa\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>Roddy estava numa taverna quando ouviu uma discuss\u00e3o sobre elfos negros, e assim descobriu que Drizzt ainda vivia, e que Tephanis mentiu pra ele.</p> <p>No caminho para Mirabar os frades e o drow entram em um tunel e se deparam com um caminho alternativo que normalmente estava fechado. Eles ouvem ent\u00e3o gritos de socorro, mas ficam receosos de entrar pois l\u00e1 ficava o covil de Hephaestus, um grande drag\u00e3o vermelho que ficou famoso por derreter min\u00e9rios para os an\u00f5es em troca de tesouros. Ao entrarem no corredor a porta atr\u00e1s deles se fecha e \u00e9 trancada por Tephanis, que volta satisfeito para Roddy dizendo que n\u00e3o teve sinal do drow.</p> <p>Drizzt l\u00ea um livro sobre drag\u00f5es que pegou da casa do ranger anci\u00e3o e assim bola um ardil para escapar do covil do drag\u00e3o com seus cinco companheiros mendigos. Ele finge ser um drag\u00e3o negro que foi preso em forma de drow e usa a vasta vaidade do drag\u00e3o vermelho para escapar do seu covil enquanto ele fecha os olhos para soprar seu fogo contra a parede que comumente usava para derreter os min\u00e9rios. Soprando seu fogo por um longo tempo afim de provar que tem um sopro mais longo que o drag\u00e3o negro que o desafia o drag\u00e3o s\u00f3 percebe que seu ouro mudou quando os frades j\u00e1 est\u00e3o pr\u00f3ximos da sa\u00edda, com bolsos um pouco mais pesados.</p> <p>Assim Drizzt enriquece seus amigos e recebe uma dire\u00e7\u00e3o para onde ir, o Vale do Vento G\u00e9lido, onde os Dez-Burgos abriga toda sorte de renegados. Indo naquela dire\u00e7\u00e3o Roddy descobre os frades e Tephanis espantado deixa passar que o drag\u00e3o deveria ter dado conta deles, e Roddy ent\u00e3o percebe que ele tentou dar conta do drow sozinho, esmurrando o sprite at\u00e9 a morte. Ele ent\u00e3o tortura os frades e logo est\u00e1 no encal\u00e7o de Drizzt em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao norte g\u00e9lido.</p> <p>Chegando na cidade principal de dez-burgos o drow conversa com o porta-voz Cassius, que se compadece do elfo negro mas diz que as pessoas da cidade causariam um alvoro\u00e7o muito grande com a presen\u00e7a do drow. Por isso ele diz que pode cuidar da sua entrada na cidade depois que ele realizar uma miss\u00e3o: defender a encosta norte da montanha do Sepulcro de Kelvin, que fica ao norte da cidade e \u00e9 rodeada por uma cidade an\u00e3.</p> <p>Cattibrie \u00e9 uma menina humana orf\u00e3, e a filha adotada do rei an\u00e3o Bruenor Martelo-de-Batalha. Ela estava passeando pelo Sepulcro de Kelvin quando se encontrou com Guenhwivar e Drizzt. Logo os dois ficaram amigos e compartilharam hist\u00f3rias. Mas Bruenor estava apreensivo e proibiu a menina de ver o drow.</p> <p>Numa de suas patrulhas o an\u00e3o se encontra com um BLA, um verme invernal que quase o mata, n\u00e3o fosse pela pantera de Drizzt. Mas ainda assim o an\u00e3o o insulta e n\u00e3o recebe o elfo negro com animosidade.</p> <p>Depois disso ele fica em duvida se drizzt queria salva-lo ou ataca-lo mas mesmo assim guarda para si. Dias depois chega em seu sal\u00e3o Roddy McGristle com seu c\u00e3o amarelo, dizendo que Drizzt era assassino e que o an\u00e3o deveria ajuda-lo a ca\u00e7ar o elfo. Mas Bruenor descarta tudo que o ca\u00e7ador fala, pois sua filha amada fica apreensiva e angustiada com as acusa\u00e7\u00f5es, e ele acredita nela.</p> <p>Depois disso ele proibe a menina de ver o drow e ela foge entristecida. Vai ver drizzt e o alerta sobre Roddy, antes cobrando de Drizzt a sua vers\u00e3o do assassinato dos fazendeiros Thistledown. Ela acredita nele e vai embora mas \u00e9 pega por Roddy que tenta segur\u00e1-la com segundas inten\u00e7\u00f5es nojentas. Mas drizzt aparece e a resgata. Drizzt \u00e9 provocado pelo humano grosseiro a mat\u00e1-lo mas ele n\u00e3o consegue, desmaiando o homem e se arrumando para partir para sempre, ciente de que Roddy nunca vai deixar de persegui-lo. No amanhecer de sua partida ele v\u00ea a carruagem do ca\u00e7ador de recompensas ir em bora e se d\u00e1 de frente com Bruenor, que diz que ele pode ficar l\u00e1 e que deve cuidar de Cattibrie.</p>"},{"location":"lore/drizzt/l3-exilio/","title":"Volume 3 - Ex\u00edlio","text":"<p>Drizzt est\u00e1 vivendo nas cavernas do subterr\u00e2neo e compartilha uma galeria com um grupo de homens fungo.

Dinin fala com sarcasmo sobre sinafay e briza lan\u00e7a seu chicote de serpentes contra ele. Depois disso eles perseguem Drizzt a partir da emana\u00e7\u00e3o do seu pendente da casa Do Urden. Drizzt percebe isso e prepara uma armadilha usando Gwenhivar para atrair a tropa enquanto Briza e Dinin esperam. Assim Drizzt cai sobre eles e numa luta furiosa com Briza corta todas as serpentes do seu chicote e dois dedos da sua m\u00e3o, n\u00e3o a matando apenas pela interven\u00e7\u00e3o da pantera.</p> <p>Drizzt n\u00e3o aguenta mais a solid\u00e3o e parece na beira da loucura.

Eles viajam para o oeste e deixam um acampamento falso para o rastreador Drow que est\u00e1 seguindo eles.</p> <p>Em um certo dia encontram uma luz verde e se deparam com uma cratera e um lago de \u00e1cido borbulhante, trespassado por diversas pontes de pedra. No meio da travessia s\u00e3o surpreendidos por corbos, seres humanoides com cabe\u00e7a de ave. Eles s\u00e3o obrigados a lutar em cima das estruturas.</p> <p>A dupla encontra um mago humano que os recebe de forma agressiva e foge. Depois encontram um estalador que na verdade era um Pech, um ser conectando com a pedra. Ele foi transformado em um estalador pelo mago, que matou seus amigos. Drizzt decide ajuda-lo, rastreando o mago e obrigando a reverter o feiti\u00e7o. Quando finalmente encontram ele na sua torre m\u00f3vel e mandam ele reverter o feiti\u00e7o, ele resmunga que deveria ter matado o Pech apelidado de Estalo por Belwar. Ninguem ouve a nao ser o estalador com sua super audi\u00e7\u00e3o, que n\u00e3o resiste o impulso e estra\u00e7alha o mago.</p> <p>O trio sente uma presen\u00e7a nos buracos do teto da caverna, e subitamente aparecem v\u00e1rios ilithid, devoradores de mentes. Seres bipedes com cara de polvo que possuem poderosas habilidades psiquicas. Eles rapidamente subjulgam o trio e os leva para sua fortaleza como escravos.</p> <p>Belwar \u00e9 levado para lutar na arena, Drizzt vai para o centro do castelo massagear o Deus dos Ilithid, p c\u00e9rebro central, uma massa amorfa que manda em todos os devoradores. Enquanto isso Estalo cuida do rebanho de roth\u00e9 e outros seres que servem de comida para os monstros, e dentre os tr\u00eas \u00e9 o \u00fanico que parece manter um pouco da sua personalidade dividida entre o ganchador e o pech.</p> <p>Dinin vai escondido at\u00e9 a cidade pedir mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre zak e drizzt para jarlaxle.

Ela matou um e se agarrou ao outro, indo junto para o plano terrestre. Belwar estava quase voltando com suas mem\u00f3rias e reconhece gwenhivar e manda ela atras de drizzt. Enquanto isso zak chega no covil e come\u00e7a a dizimar os ilithids e seus escravos mentais.</p> <p>Gwenhivar estra\u00e7alha o cerebro central e todos os escravos e ilithids entram em polvorosa. Belwar recupera os equipamentos deles e se junta a drizzt e estalo, mas antes de fugirem zaknafein aparece. Drizzt corre para ele mas descobre que ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 o zak que ele conhecia, e perfurando seu peito e vendo o antigo mestre de armas ainda de p\u00e9 ele se apavora com a vis\u00e3o. Um ilithid dispara seu raio mental e drizzt cai, mas zaknafein n\u00e3o \u00e9 afetado. Estalo salva o drow ao recuperar sua consciencia pech e invocar um parede de pedra que barra o caminho de zaknafein.

Assim que chegam na metade e Estalo desaparece na dobra no fim do corredor, um grito de dor \u00e9 ouvido, e em seguida surge Zaknafein. Ele e drizzt come\u00e7am a lutar e belwar vai ver o pech agora destransformado e morto. Drizzt reconhece o estilo de luta de zak e come\u00e7a a entender o que \u00e9 a apari\u00e7\u00e3o espectral zin-carla.</p> <p>Drizzt guarda as cimitarras e espera, mas zaknafein recupera o controle e n\u00e3o o ataca. Eles conversam e no fim zak se joga do penhasco para o lago de \u00e1cido, o \u00fanico jeito de evitar assassinar seu filho. Matriarca Mal\u00edcia fica sem ar e se contorce de agonia, quando percebe que atr\u00e1s dela sua filha Briza est\u00e1 com o chicote de serpentes na m\u00e3o.

Tem o capit\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Magalh\u00e3es, ex\u00edmio mentiroso e trapaceador, tem O Velho, que perdeu seu filho para o Coronel Horacio em Ilheus quando esse veio tomar da sua familia a rocinha que tinham constru\u00eddo, tem Margot, uma mulher loira e bonita que est\u00e1 indo encontrar seu doutor, tem o Juca, cabra macho e lider de um grupo de jagun\u00e7os que mata rouba as terras dos outros. Tem ainda Ant\u00f4nio V\u00edtor, que deixou sua cidadezinha de Est\u00e2ncia e a sua amada em busca de promessas de dinheiro, mas prometeu voltar quando tivesse algo, mesmo pelo descr\u00e9dito de sua companheira. </p> <p>Depois ele fala da mata, da mata selvagem e virgem sem a presen\u00e7a dos homens. Cheia de vida, com on\u00e7as, macacos, cobras e coruj\u00f5es. E os homens vem explorar e se apavoram com a sua densidade, e dizem ver assombra\u00e7\u00f5es, como lobisomem, mula sem cabe\u00e7a e outros. Mas antes de fugirem aparece Juca Badar\u00f3, que n\u00e3o v\u00ea assombra\u00e7\u00e3o na mata selvagem, apenas cacaueiros e seus frutos dourados. </p> <p>Depois descreve o coronel Horacio, de como era bandido e n\u00e3o respeitava seus trabalhadores, era muito rico e tinha muitas lendas a seu respeito. </p> <p>Em seguida descreve a vida da sua mulher Ester, uma jovem linda e melanc\u00f3lica que vive sozinha na mans\u00e3o do Coronel, com seu filho e com medo das cobras e da mata sempre agourenta nas costas da casa. </p> <p>Juca Badar\u00f3 fala com seu irm\u00e3o, o Senhor Badar\u00f3, sobre a rocinha de Firmo, que ele n\u00e3o quer vender de jeito nenhum e que v\u00e3o ter que dar cabo dele, pois aquela ro\u00e7a \u00e9 muito importante para o dom\u00ednio dos Badar\u00f3, que aquela terra tem a melhor casa para o cacau. O senhor Badar\u00f3 n\u00e3o queria recorrer a viol\u00eancia a n\u00e3o ser que fosse sua \u00faltima sa\u00edda, e indaga Juca se ele n\u00e3o se arrepende, se ele n\u00e3o tem cora\u00e7\u00e3o. Mesmo assim ele d\u00e1 a ordem. </p> <p>E deu a ordem ao mulato sarar\u00e1 Viriato e ao negro Dami\u00e3o, o cabra mais certeiro do sert\u00e3o. Era o jagun\u00e7o favorito do senhor badar\u00e1, e at\u00e9 saiu no jornal da Bahia como a mira mais certeira. Foi eles dois convocados para a Tocaia, cada um de um lado da estrada esperando a v\u00edtima passar. Mas Dami\u00e3o ficou aflito com as palavras do senhor, que ele considerava um Deus. Ser\u00e1 que ele n\u00e3o tinha cora\u00e7\u00e3o, n\u00e3o sentia nada ao matar? Assim Dami\u00e3o \u00e9 atormentado pela ideia, e lembra da mulher de Firmo, Dona Teresa, mulher linda e carism\u00e1tica que sempre lhe dava \u00e1gua ou at\u00e9 pinga quando Dami\u00e3o voltava perto de suas terras. Assim ele fica aflito entre ter que matar e desrespeitar seu patr\u00e3o. </p> <p>Hor\u00e1cio e Ester recebem com seu compadre Manecas Dantas o advogado estrangeiro Virg\u00edlio, um homem loiro e delicado que flerta com Ester e faz ela voltar para o tempo do col\u00e9gio de freiras, quando sonhava com Paris, moda e bailes pomposos. No jantar os dois dominaram a conversa e Ester foi levada pelo vinho portugues, enquanto Horacio a olhava orgulhoso e com vaidade para a mulher que tinha. Ester ent\u00e3o foi convencida a tocar o piano que h\u00e1 muito deixara enferrujar, mas quando Virg\u00edlio insistiu ela tocou sua salsa que envolveu toda a casa e transbordou na mata. No fim, Virgilio parabeniza com palmas e comenta para s\u00f3 ela ouvir: \u201ccomo um passarinho na boca de uma cobra\u201d, se referindo ao som das r\u00e3s sendo mortas, algo que atormentava Ester e que foi contado com esc\u00e1rnio por Horacio, mas recebido com compaix\u00e3o e compreens\u00e3o por Virg\u00edlio. </p> <p>Se de um lado da mata Negro Dami\u00e3o aguarda na tocaia, e do lado de outra mata Virg\u00edlio conhece Ester, em outra mata aos p\u00e9s de um rio Ant\u00f4nio Vitor pensa na sua amada em Est\u00e2ncia, sobre a sua chegada ali, no trabalho pesado na ro\u00e7a, no seu primeiro homem que ele baixou para proteger Juca Barad\u00f3, de como depois ele foi para a cidade e conheceu as mulheres de l\u00e1, de como agora ele virou capanga de Juca e de como agora n\u00e3o pensa mais em sua amada nem sua terra natal, apenas no trabalho, no dinheiro, na mata e na mulata Raimunda, afilhada de Don\u2019Ana e prov\u00e1vel bastarda dos Barad\u00f3. </p> <p>Maneca Dantas era dono da Fazenda dos Macacos, em Sequeira Grande, no sul da terra entre os Badar\u00f3 e Hor\u00e1cio. Dois homens batem na porta de Auric\u00eddia, mulher de Maneca. Os homens carregam um cadaver numa rede, dizem que vieram l\u00e1 de Barad\u00f3, que est\u00e3o levando o morto para Ferradas ser enterrado com suas filhas. A mulher n\u00e3o deixa eles descansarem ali, com medo do que matou o homem, \u201ca febre da mata\u201d. Febre tif\u00f3ide, que naquela \u00e9poca ningu\u00e9m conhecia e que matava sem chance de cura. Nem o Jeremias, feiticeiro de Sequeira Grande que sabia das ervas tinha rem\u00e9dio pra ela. </p> <p>Os homens ent\u00e3o continuam sua caminhada e param na primeira casa dos trabalhadores que encontram. L\u00e1 eles descansam enquanto conversam com um cearense rec\u00e9m chegado. Um deles explica sobre a vida na ro\u00e7a: tu chega sem nada, precisa pegar enchada, p\u00e1 e fac\u00e3o no armazem da fazenda, fiado. Depois pega comida pra semana, que custa 2/3 do sal\u00e1rio. O 1/3 restante vai pra d\u00edvida das ferramentas que tu s\u00f3 paga depois de um ano de trabalho. Assim, resume dizendo que a promessa de riqueza \u00e9 fal\u00e1cia, que s\u00f3 jagun\u00e7o que sabe matar \u00e9 que ganha algum dinheiro. </p> <p>Ester fica imaginando Virg\u00edlio enquanto Hor\u00e1cio vem possu\u00ed-la, ele acha que ela faz tudo para ele mas ela secretamente est\u00e1 apaixonada por Virg\u00edlio. Durante a transa batem na porta do Coronel, Maneca que dormia na rede na sala atende e grita por Hor\u00e1cio. Todos se levantam e encontram Firmo com uma cara apavorada e molhado do chuvisco. Ele diz que os Badar\u00f3 mandaram mat\u00e1-lo, e que tem certeza porque viu Negro Dami\u00e3o dando o tiro e saindo correndo como louco quando errou o tiro. Hor\u00e1cio explica para Virg\u00edlio, que Firmo tinha uma ro\u00e7a entre os Badar\u00f3 e a mata de Sequeira Grande, e eles querem ela e acham que tem direito \u00e0 ela, por estarem em cima na pol\u00edtica. Diz que quem tem Sequeira Grande tem tudo, que \u00e9 a melhor terra pro cacau, e que agora vai juntar todos fazendeiros aliados com ro\u00e7as em Sequeira e vai ter guerra contra os Badar\u00f3. </p> <p>Don\u2019Ana Badar\u00f3 era filha do Sinh\u00f4 Badar\u00f3 e estava preocupada naquela noite. Juca e Sinh\u00f4 esperavam ela come\u00e7ar a leitura da b\u00edblia, que sinh\u00f4 pedia pra ela ler todos os dias em p\u00e1ginas aleat\u00f3rias e que ele as tomava como press\u00e1gios. Depois da primeira leitura sinh\u00f4 disse que Sequeira grande seria deles e que agora n\u00e3o tinha d\u00favidas, mas isso mudou quando Viriato chegou dizendo que Dami\u00e3o errou o tiro, ent\u00e3o souberam que teriam guerra, e que precisavam atacar antes que Hor\u00e1cio. Don\u2019Ana se recusou a sair da sala junto das mulheres, Juca protestou mas sinh\u00f4 deixou ela ficar, porque era Badar\u00f3 e seus filhos iriam colher o cacau de Sequeira Grande. </p> <p>Jeremias o feiticeiro era um escravo que fugiu da fazenda e se refugiou na mata com os indios. Aprendeu com eles sua medicina com ervas e era conhecido em toda a regi\u00e3o, desde os portos at\u00e9 a cidade. Muitos iam at\u00e9 ele pedir cura e ben\u00e7\u00e3o. Ele cultuava seus deuses da \u00e1frica e tinha duas cobras mansas de estima\u00e7\u00e3o. Viu o homem chegar e derrubar a mata para suas fazendas, e nada o parou, nem mesmo quando Jeremias contou que as \u00e1rvores eram sagradas e que aquele que as derrubasse seria amaldi\u00e7oado. Quando negro dami\u00e3o veio correndo desesperado e contou sua hist\u00f3ria para o feiticeiro, ele viu que era o fim de Sequeira Grande, e rogou sua praga de vingan\u00e7a para seus deuses e para Exu, dizendo que ali iam regar os campos com sangue, campos escuros da sombra dos abutres, e depois disso caiu morto. </p> <p>A segunda parte come\u00e7a com a hist\u00f3ria das tr\u00eas irm\u00e3s filhas do defunto, que chega em casa com a not\u00edcia do erro de Dami\u00e3o, e de como isso significa guerra. </p> <p>Al\u00e9m da hist\u00f3ria das irm\u00e3s, a segunda parte \u00e9 sobre as cidades, como por exemplo Ferradas, um povoado que cresceu ao redor de um armaz\u00e9m de cacau do coronel horacio, e depois virou rota de caixeiros-viajantes e de todos aqueles que queriam explorar as matas. Mas logo ela ficou para tr\u00e1s por causa de Trabocas, a cidade que Dr. Virg\u00edlio ficava com sua amante, Margot, a mo\u00e7a bonita que foi de barco at\u00e9 l\u00e1 e que Juca Badar\u00f3 ficou dizendo que ela seria dele. Margot era uma mo\u00e7a da Bahia e conhecia Virg\u00edlio do cabar\u00e9, era uma beldade espalhafatosa e se juntou a ele depois que o mesmo quis desistir de tudo ai perder o pai. Ele convenceu ela a ir com ele para Ilh\u00e9us mas agora vivia reclamando de que fez a coisa errada, que era para ele ter ido para o Rio. </p> <p>Em Tabocas a fofoca corre solta e as not\u00edcias da vinda de Teodoro para l\u00e1 assustou ao Dr. Jess\u00e9, compadre pol\u00edtico de Hor\u00e1cio. Teodoro foi coronel com ro\u00e7a em Sequeira que se aliou aos Badar\u00f3. Para piorar, agora as m\u00e1s-l\u00ednguas dizem que Virgilio est\u00e1 de caso com Ester. </p> <p>O trambiqueiro Capit\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Magalh\u00e3es se aproxima de Juca Badar\u00f3 e combina com ele de medir as terras de Sequeira Grande. Depois de levar tudo no poker eles v\u00e3o dan\u00e7ar e presenciam Margot e Virgilio brigarem e o Doutor partir. Juca fica de olho na mo\u00e7a e Jo\u00e3o aproveita para fazer os lados entre os dois, pois \u00e9 amigo dela. Convence ela a ficar com Juca e lucrar com isso aproveitando a oportunidade. Enquanto isso Virg\u00edlio vai secretamente ver Ester, na ignor\u00e2ncia dos apaixonados ainda n\u00e3o percebeu que toda a cidade sabe que eles est\u00e3o de caso. </p> <p>Capit\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o vai para a fazenda dos badar\u00f3 e sobrevive a sua farsa medindo a terra apenas concordando com a opini\u00e3o dos outros. Pretende fazer o servi\u00e7o, lucrar e escapulir, mas acaba se apaixonando por Don\u2019Ana. Ele j\u00e1 n\u00e3o sabe o que fazer, porque sabe que vai ter problemas quando descobrirem as mentiras dele. </p> <p>Na cidade de Ilh\u00e9us eles se reunem na festa de S\u00e3o Jorge, quando at\u00e9 Sinh\u00f4 Badar\u00f3 e Hor\u00e1cio se unem em harmonia. </p> <p>As hist\u00f3rias da conquista de sequeiro grande s\u00e3o contadas pelos poetas e m\u00fasicos e por aqueles que ainda se lembram daqueles tempos. E foram tempos de muita viol\u00eancia e morte, com os dois lados contratando cada vez mais jagun\u00e7os. </p> <p>Virgilio agora amante de Ester vai passar a noite no cabar\u00e9, pois horacio esta em ilheus. Ele encontra o jornalista manoel com margot e ela o cumprimenta com desejo no olhar. Maneca dantas instiga virgilio a dan\u00e7ar com a antiga amante para movimentar as hist\u00f3rias sobre eles e assim melar a fama de Juca, mas Jo\u00e3o Magalh\u00e3es avisa Juca e esse amea\u00e7a o doutor. Por conta disso come\u00e7a a correr o boato de que virgilio amarelou e \u00e9 um covarde, e agora horacio diz que ele deve mandar matar Juca para recuperar sua honra. </p> <p>Virg\u00edlio manda o cabra matar Juca, mas Ant\u00f4nio Vicente o salva novamente ao por acaso atirar na moita onde o cabra estava de tocaia e descobrir ele ali prestes a dar o tiro. Juca oferece uma ro\u00e7a para ele como recompensa e ele pede para se casar com Raimunda, a mulata que cresceu com a filha do Sinh\u00f4. Al\u00e9m dela Don\u2019Ana tamb\u00e9m foi pedida em casamento pelo capit\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Magalh\u00e3es. Mesmo com o dinheiro da safra chegando ao fim o casamento de Don\u2019Ana promete ser extravagante, com roupas e sapatos vindos do Rio. </p> <p>Enquanto isso Horacio pegou a febre da mata depois de passar o dia com Dr. Jess\u00e9 e com a fam\u00edlia de S\u00edlvio M\u00e3ozinhas, que tinha ca\u00eddo na ro\u00e7a com a febre. O coronel sobrevive, mas Ester acaba pegando tamb\u00e9m. </p> <p>Ester acaba morrendo e Juca Badar\u00f3 tamb\u00e9m, mas n\u00e3o de febre, \u00e9 morto por um tiro quando estava visitando ilh\u00e9us. Virg\u00edlio tamb\u00e9m morre, muito depois de Ester, Horacio encontra cartas de amor dela para o doutor. Antes disso tem o julgamento de Horacio e esse \u00e9 absolvido por unanimidade. O governo faz uma interven\u00e7\u00e3o na cidade e subitamente os badar\u00f3s perdem seu poder pol\u00edtico e assim a corrida por Sequeira Grande. </p> <p>Don\u2019Ana e Sinh\u00f4 Badar\u00f3 sobrevivem, Tabocas vira cidade e muda de nome para Itabuna. Sequeiro Grande tem frutos de cacau mais r\u00e1pido que qualquer outra regi\u00e3o, e assim o livro termina a hist\u00f3ria dessa regi\u00e3o regada a sangue.</p>"},{"location":"lore/lovecraft/cao-de-caca/","title":"O C\u00e3o de Ca\u00e7a","text":"<p>Uma das melhores hist\u00f3rias at\u00e9 agora. \u00c9 bem descritiva e sanguinolenta, com muito ocultismo e um terror mais f\u00edsico, na forma do monstruoso c\u00e3o de ca\u00e7a. Um ladr\u00e3o de t\u00famulos descreve como ele e seu amigo foram levados \u00e0 pr\u00e1tica depois de perderem o interesse por qualquer outra forma de entretenimento e lazer. Eles foram para um antigo cemit\u00e9rio na Holanda onde um lend\u00e1rio ladr\u00e3o de t\u00famulos estava enterrado com seus esp\u00f3lios. Chegando l\u00e1 encontram morcegos gigantes e ouvem um som monstruoso parecido com um c\u00e3o de ca\u00e7a. Eles encontram um estranho amuleto de jade com inscri\u00e7\u00f5es em uma l\u00edngua estranha, que eles se recordam de ver no livro Necronomicon, do \u00e1rabe louco Abdul Alhazred.

Na primeira o narrador conta sobre o seu tio arque\u00f3logo que faleceu recentemente e deixou tudo para ele. Ao examinar suas notas o narrador encontra uma pe\u00e7a estranha em baixo relevo que ele nunca viu antes, e diversas notas escritas por seu tio, junto com recortes de jornais. Fala sobre como um jovem escultor chegou num certo dia \u00e0 casa do tio com uma pe\u00e7a em baixo relevo que ele sonhou. Era uma figura com cabe\u00e7a de polvo, corpo human\u00f3ide e asas de morcego, e nos lados tinha escritas em uma lingua desconhecida. O velho professor arque\u00f3logo ficou obcecado pela pe\u00e7a, como se tivesse relacionado com algo do seu passado. Ele pede para o rapaz contar mais sobre esses sonhos, e ele diz que tem vis\u00f5es de uma cidade molhada com uma\u00a0geometria toda errada. Dias depois um grande tremor acontece e o rapaz entra em uma esp\u00e9cie de coma nervoso, diversos jovens artistas come\u00e7am a relatar sonhos estranhos com a cidade cicl\u00f3pica e o ser monstruoso descrito de forma parecida com aquele da escultura. O per\u00edodo \u00e9 entre 23 de mar\u00e7o e 2 de abril. Tanto o jovem escultor como os outros artistas relatam sonhos com a cidade, o monstro, e os sons guturais que ao tentarem se escritos com s\u00edmbolos romanos seria algo como \"Cthulhu\", \"R'lyeh\" e \"ftaghn\".</p> <p>A segunda parte relata de onde o professor reconheceu a escultura de argila em baixo relevo. Foi de uma conven\u00e7\u00e3o de arqueologia onde o professor e os mais not\u00f3rios cientistas entraram em contato com um inspetor de pol\u00edcia da Louisiana, que carregava uma escultura em pedra verde rugosa nunca antes vista. Todos ficaram estupefatos com a ancestralidade da pe\u00e7a, e com o seu estilo est\u00e9tico nunca antes visto nas culturas da antiguidade. Um dos professores se lembra de ver algo parecido quando viajava pelo Tibete e encontrou um culto de esquim\u00f3s fren\u00e9ticos.</p> <p>(Lovecraft exala racismo em diversos momentos, especialmente quando fala de outros povos, sempre relacionando a cultura africana a coisas ruins ou selvagens)</p> <p>O inspetor ent\u00e3o relata como tomou posse do objeto. Ele diz que um povoado perto do p\u00e2ntano os chamou quando diversas pessoas sumiram da vila, e que estavam ouvindo c\u00e2nticos e tambores bem dentro da floresta negra e proibida. L\u00e1 dentro os policiais acharam uma cena de horror quando adentraram uma clareira onde cultistas dan\u00e7avam e faziam sacrif\u00edcios humanos \u00e0 pequena estatueta que se encontrava num altar elevado e circundado por chamas.</p> <p>Tanto o inspetor como o professor do relato do tibete concordam sobre as palavras que ouviram, e com ajuda dos cultistas presos e interrogados chegam nas informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os Deuses Antigos, que viviam na terra antes do homem e que jazem dormindo na cidade afundada de R'lyeh. Eles n\u00e3o s\u00e3o materiais, mas transitam entre dimens\u00f5es e conversam com os humanos a partir de sonhos. Um dia quando as estrelas estiverem alinhadas eles acordar\u00e3o, com a ajuda do sumo sacerdote Cthulhu. O trabalho dos cultistas \u00e9 fortalecer e viabilizar esse despertar.</p> <p>A terceira parte \u00e9 sobre um marinheiro noruegu\u00eas que virou not\u00edcia depois de ser encontrado delirando em um barco, ele abra\u00e7ava uma estatueta parecida com aquela de Cthulhu. O marinheiro relata sobre como sua tripula\u00e7\u00e3o foi bloqueada por um iate suspeito com \"mesti\u00e7os\" (racista do krl). Quando o navio do noruegu\u00eas quis continuar, o iate abriu fogo contra eles e uma luta sangrenta se deu no conv\u00e9s do navio. Os \"mesti\u00e7os\" foram massacrados e os oito sobreviventes n\u00f3rdicos encontraram um estranho altar na cabine do iate. Curiosos sobre o que o iate estava bloqueando passagem, eles avan\u00e7aram em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao que parecia ser uma ilha n\u00e3o catalogada. Chegando mais perto notaram que era um mon\u00f3lito gigantesco de pedra esverdeada, que o narrador faz a rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a cidade inundada e cicl\u00f3pica de R'lyeh. Ele quase se desespera ao imaginar que aquela ilha era apenas o topo de uma estrutura dedicada ao sumo-sacerdote Cthulhu. O marinheiro conta sem entrar em detalhes que alguns dos seus companheiros desfalece apenas ao descerem nas praias da ilha, e que ele e os restantes decidem escalar a estrutura pegajosa at\u00e9 o seu topo. L\u00e1 eles encontram o que pode ser descrito como uma gigantesca porta, mesmo que seja dif\u00edcil ter certeza devido \u00e0 sua geometria alien\u00edgena e n\u00e3o-euclidiana. O portal tit\u00e2nico desliza para a diagonal e abre uma bocarra negra de sombras quase palp\u00e1veis, e l\u00e1 dentro eles escutam um som nojento de algo bulboso se rastejando. Dois dos companheiros morrem de horror na hora, e os outros observam delirantemente o gigantesco ser com cabe\u00e7a de lula, corpo de drag\u00e3o e asas de morcego que cambaleia pelas paredes verdes em dire\u00e7\u00e3o dos marinheiros.

Bilbo adotou Frodo depois que seus pais se afogaram l\u00e1 na terra dos Buques. E deixou ele como seu herdeiro, para o desespero dos Sacola-Bolseiros. Bilbo era fruto de lendas, ele tinha tesouros e riquezas inimagin\u00e1veis, e n\u00e3o parecia envelhecer nunca, estando pr\u00f3ximo dos seus 111 anos de vida. Frodo faz anivers\u00e1rio no mesmo dia que ele, 22 de setembro, e vai fazer 33 anos, a idade da maioridade intelectual dos hobbits. Uma grande festa est\u00e1 preparada, correndo rumores a partir do filho do Feitor e mais novo ajudante e jardineiro dos Bolseiros, Samwise Gamgi. A festa \u00e9 celebrada com a ajuda de an\u00e3os e do mago Gandalf, que chega com uma carga de fogos de artif\u00edcios. Todos s\u00e3o convidados e recebem presentes magn\u00edficos, raros e por vezes m\u00e1gicos. Depois de um desjejum, um almo\u00e7o e uma grande ceia, Bilbo se prepara para o seu discurso.</p> <p>Bilbo faz um discurso no seu anivers\u00e1rio e encerra dizendo adeus, e iria embora. Ent\u00e3o bota o anel e some. Volta para casa e come\u00e7a a se arrumar para partir, deixando tudo organizado para Frodo. Quase tudo, na verdade, de \u00faltima hora n\u00e3o consegue deixar o envelope com o anel para Frodo. Gandalf aparece e conversa com ele sobre isso, que inesperadamente come\u00e7a a se portar como o Gollum, chamando o anel de seu precioso e ficando agressivo com a insist\u00eancia de Gandalf para deix\u00e1-lo para tr\u00e1s.</p> <p>Bilbo finalmente se liberta do anel e parte para sua jornada na companhia de tr\u00eas an\u00e3os. Gandalf espera pensativo a chegada de Frodo, que recebe com espanto o anel e a escritura que diz que ele \u00e9 o novo dono de Bols\u00e3o. Gandalf diz que ele n\u00e3o deve usar o Anel e parte em seguida. Frodo ent\u00e3o fica respons\u00e1vel por enviar todos os pertences que Bilbo deu de presente para seus parentes, at\u00e9 que Gandalf volta todo misterioso dizendo para ele n\u00e3o usar o Anel e deix\u00e1-lo escondido e em segredo</p> <p>Gandalf retorna depois de v\u00e1rios anos. Frodo o percebe mais soturno e cansado, como se a idade tivesse chegado mais r\u00e1pido para ele nos \u00faltimos tempos. Eles passam a noite conversando e Gandalf revela finalmente a natureza do Anel de Bilbo: \u00c9 um Anel de Poder, capaz de estender a vida daquele que o usa, por\u00e9m o subjulgando ao seu dom\u00ednio. Por isso Bilbo estava se sentindo \"esticado\", sempre preocupado com o Anel e sempre querendo us\u00e1-lo. O anel parece ter vida pr\u00f3pria, se estendendo e diminuindo para assim entrar ou sair do dedo daquele que ele deseja dominar.</p> <p>Gandalf diz que desde que Bilbo pegou o Anel e ap\u00f3s expulsar o Necromante Sauron de Trevamata ele suspeita do real poder dele. Saruman \u00e9 o mago l\u00edder do Conselho, e o perito em an\u00e9is m\u00e1gicos. Ele reassegura Gandalf de que n\u00e3o \u00e9 o Um Anel, e que n\u00e3o precisa se preocupar. Isso o deixa relaxado e ele o tira da mente, um erro que ele se arrepende profundamente. Pois enquanto isso o antigo dono do Anel, Sm\u00e9agol, o Gollum, estava a solta tentando encontrar Bilbo. Ele viaja por Trevamata, e at\u00e9 por Valle, sempre sorrateiramente, andando no escuro dos dias e noites sem astro no c\u00e9u. Assim ele fica sabendo de muita coisa sobre Bilbo, e acaba sendo atra\u00eddo para Mordor, as terras sombrias de Sauron. L\u00e1 ele \u00e9 eventualmente capturado e assim torturado por informa\u00e7\u00e3o, e acaba dizendo para o Mestre das Sombras que o seu precioso Um Anel ainda existe, e est\u00e1 sob posse de um tal de Bilbo Bolseiro, um Hobbit.</p> <p>Frodo reconhece o seu papel como portador do Anel, at\u00e9 que ele seja alocado com seguran\u00e7a. Para isso, n\u00e3o deve permanecer no Condado, pois arriscaria a vida de todos. Deve ent\u00e3o partir, mas n\u00e3o sozinho, seu amigo Sam Gamgi estava do lado de fora ouvindo, fingindo cortar as cercas-vivas. Quando \u00e9 pego por Gandalf, diz que adoraria ver os Elfos e assim \u00e9 ordenado a seguir Frodo, como puni\u00e7\u00e3o por bisbilhotar, algo que Gandalf diz como de brincadeira, pois sabe que o jovem Sam seguiria o mestre Frodo se o deixassem</p> <p>No dia do seu anivers\u00e1rio, Frodo decide partir para Brandeburgo, se mudando para l\u00e1 acredita que levantaria menos suspeitas. Ele vendeu Bols\u00e3o para os Sacola-Bolseiros, e quando chega o dia ele parte com Sam e Pippin T\u00fbk a partir da rua antiga que passa pelas Colinas-Verdejantes. Antes de sair ele escuta o Feitor conversando com uma voz estranha que pergunta por ele, acha esquisito, mas n\u00e3o d\u00e1 aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Depois de um dia caminhando em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao leste, eles ouvem sons de galope na estrada, e Frodo tem o pressentimento de se esconder, diz que n\u00e3o quer ser visto por bisbilhoteiros e caso for Gandalf eles podem preg\u00e1-lo uma pe\u00e7a. Assim se escondem e pelo seu bem, pois o cavaleiro \u00e9 um ser sinistro em um grande cavalo preto, e ele mesmo veste um capuz e panos negros. O cavaleiro d\u00e1 uma farejada no ar bem do lado onde Frodo se escondeu, e em seguida parte a galope. Sam diz que \u00e9 o mesmo cavaleiro que interpelou seu pai, o Feitor no dia anterior.</p> <p>Os hobbits est\u00e3o caminhando tranquilamente em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 terra dos buques, quando de subito escutam cascos novamente, se escondem e aguardam a chegada do cavaleiro negro. Ele fareja Frodo e come\u00e7a a engatinhar em sua dire\u00e7\u00e3o, crescendo de s\u00fabito a vontade dele de p\u00f4r o anel no dedo. Antes de mais nada, uma suave can\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7a a ser ouvida na dist\u00e2ncia, e a sombra negra foge. Era Gildor Inglorion e sua companhia de altos elfos. Eles iam passando quando voltam e d\u00e3o oi para os hobbits. Que os interpela sobre os motivos de suas andan\u00e7as. Em seguida, Pippin pede informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os cavaleiros-negros. Os elfos ficam preocupados e decidem escoltar os hobbits pelo caminho. Levam eles at\u00e9 uma clareira onde um sal\u00e3o se abre com a chegada das estrelas, e l\u00e1 eles t\u00eam um banquete e descansam enquanto Frodo e Gildor conversam. Ele diz que os cavaleiros est\u00e3o a servi\u00e7o do Inimigo e que passou por Bilbo alguns dias atr\u00e1s, encerrando a conversa com um conselho de que n\u00e3o deve se demorar na estrada.</p> <p>Hobbits acordam e os elfos tinham ido, deixaram comida e bebida para eles. Pippin indaga sobre os cavaleiros-negros e Frodo est\u00e1 pesaroso de lev\u00e1-los al\u00e9m do Condado, indaga Sam se mesmo ap\u00f3s ter visto os elfos ele ainda deseja acompanh\u00e1-lo. Sam diz que ir\u00e1 onde o Sr. Frodo for, e que prometeu isso aos elfos. Eles decidem ent\u00e3o cortarem caminho pelos p\u00e2ntanos em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Balsa, evitando a estrada.</p> <p>O trio desce um barranco e v\u00ea um cavalo alto e negro em cima da encosta, com um vulto negro agachado do lado. Sabem que ele n\u00e3o vai descer, mas devem seguir r\u00e1pido. Atravessam o p\u00e2ntano e pegam uma forte chuva. Descansam quando o sol abre e bebem uma refrescante bebida \u00e9lfica dos seus cantis, revigorando-os.</p> <p>Os hobbits continuam pela floresta at\u00e9 se depararem com uma colina descampada. L\u00e1 ficaram receosos por terem de correr nos campos longe da prote\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1rvores. Avan\u00e7ando com pesar chegam a uma fazenda com port\u00e3o de ferro e casa de tijolos. Pippin reconheceu e diz que era a fazenda do Velho Sr. Magote. Frodo conta que quando morava na terra-dos-buques ele costumava roubar os cogumelos da fazenda, e Magote o colocava para correr ati\u00e7ando seus cachorros contra ele. Mas agora parecia amig\u00e1vel e ofereceu jantar, cerveja e uma escolta de carro\u00e7a at\u00e9 a Balsa no nordeste. Al\u00e9m disso, conta uma hist\u00f3ria de como um sinistro cavaleiro negro o interpelou sobre um Bolseiro, que ele disse que n\u00e3o sabia e o mandou embora. Durante a viagem at\u00e9 a Balsa surge um vulto e sons de cascos, todos ficaram de guarda, mas era Merry.</p> <p>Merry os guia pela Balsa at\u00e9 o outro lado do Brandevin, e ao olharem para tr\u00e1s parecem ver um vulto escuro rastejando pr\u00f3ximo do ancoradouro. Em seguida se dirigem para a nova morada de Frodo. Ela \u00e9 uma casa de um andar no estilo das tocas hobbits. L\u00e1 ele se v\u00ea receoso de como dizer ao pessoal que deve partir de imediato, mas para sua surpresa Merry j\u00e1 sabia, e tamb\u00e9m adivinhou toda a hist\u00f3ria do Anel e a jornada de Frodo. O brandebuque se mostrou um belo espi\u00e3o e contou como num dia viu Bilbo desaparecer ao ver os sacola-bolseiros no horizonte. Por fim decidem descansar e partir na primeira luz.</p> <p>No in\u00edcio da manh\u00e3 os quatro amigos saem pelos fundos da casa em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Floresta Velha. Fofo Bolger diz adeus aos hobbits e se despede com pesar por n\u00e3o acompanh\u00e1-los. Na floresta, Merry conta hist\u00f3rias de como seres esquisitos vivem ali, e de como parece que as \u00e1rvores s\u00e3o vivas, capazes de ver e ouvi-los, sempre cochichando entre si e ocasionalmente at\u00e9 se movendo, derrubando troncos e levantando ra\u00edzes para bloquear viajantes.</p> <p>Em uma ocasi\u00e3o as \u00e1rvores atacaram contra a Sebe que a dividia das terras dos hobbits, elas foram chegando cada vez mais perto e se encurvaram para cima da cerca. Os hobbits ent\u00e3o cortaram um monte delas e fizeram uma grande fogueira para passar uma mensagem de aviso. L\u00e1 dentro os quatro avan\u00e7am com seus p\u00f4neis, por\u00e9m logo se perdem ao se verem obrigados a seguir trilhas que mudam de dire\u00e7\u00e3o, e largas arvores que parecem bloquear seu caminho onde antes de longe parecia livre. Eles foram sendo guiados sempre para o leste e o sul, mesmo tendo como objetivo ir para o norte. Ap\u00f3s descerem uma depress\u00e3o para um c\u00f3rrego do rio Voltavime, s\u00e3o acometidos por um s\u00fabito sono, que chega com os esporos do ch\u00e3o e do topo das \u00e1rvores. Mesmo tentando resistir, todos os quatro acabam se rendendo ao sono.</p> <p>Os hobbits sonolentos se deitam sob um grande e velho salgueiro, que parece cantar para eles. Assim que se encostam no seu tronco, grandes fissuras se abrem e tragam Merry e Pippin para dentro. Frodo se e costa numa grossa raiz na beira do rio, e Sam n\u00e3o se deixa vencer e sai atr\u00e1s dos p\u00f4neis, quando volta e ouvi algo caindo na \u00e1gua e algo se fechando como uma porta silenciosa. O primeiro era Frodo sendo empurrado por uma raiz, o segundo era merry e pippin sendo tragados pelo salgueiro. Eles decidem botar fogo na arvore, mas merry e pippin come\u00e7am a gritar dizendo para apagarem, se n\u00e3o o salgueiro ir\u00e1 esmag\u00e1-los. No desespero come\u00e7am a ouvir de longe uma voz feliz cantando uma can\u00e7\u00e3o, era Tom Bombadil, que canta para o salgueiro e salva os hobbits, levando eles para sua casa.</p> <p>Tom e Fruta D Ouro contam hist\u00f3rias em can\u00e7\u00f5es sobre muitas coisas, e os hobbits aprendem muito sobre os seres da Floresta e dos arredores. Frodo se pergunta quem \u00e9 ele, e o Mestre diz ser ele mesmo, antigo a ponto de ver o povo grande surgir, os hobbits migrarem e at\u00e9 os elfos irem para o oeste, dando a entender ser um ser realmente anci\u00e3o. Ele pergunta muitas coisas aos pequenos e parece curioso acerca dos Cavaleiros Negros e do Anel. Ele pede para examin\u00e1-lo e brinca colocando no dedo, por\u00e9m sem nenhum efeito. Frodo fica curioso se aquele era mesmo o Anel e p\u00f5e em seguida, ficando invis\u00edvel. Tenta se esgueirar, por\u00e9m Tom o chama como se o visse normalmente, e diz para ouvi-lo sem o Anel no dedo, pois assim era melhor. Depois disso ele lhes d\u00e1 dicas e orienta\u00e7\u00f5es sobre por onde seguirem, os alerta sobre a Colina-dos-T\u00famulos ao leste, e sugere rumarem para o norte at\u00e9 a Estrada Leste. Caso se virem em apuros, basta cantarem uma can\u00e7\u00e3o para Tom que ele ir\u00e1 socorr\u00ea-los.</p> <p>Os hobbits se despedem de Tom e Fruta D Ouro e partem para o norte, avan\u00e7ando sob as colinas em um dia quente de marcha. Chegam em uma colina com um cume c\u00f4ncavo como uma grande tigela rasa, e l\u00e1 no meio uma grande pedra se projeta contra o sol, ela est\u00e1 fria e convidativa para os viajantes cansados, e eles decidem aproveitar sua sombra para almo\u00e7ar.</p> <p>O descanso depois do almo\u00e7o se estendeu e os quatro acabaram dormindo sem querer. Acordaram com pressa para sa\u00edrem dali antes que a noite e a neblina os engolfem. Frodo saiu disparado quando viu um port\u00e3o que marca a sa\u00edda das colinas. Por\u00e9m ao chegar l\u00e1 os postes do port\u00e3o crescem sob ele, com uma sombra que o engolfa por completo. Seu p\u00f4nei se assusta e o derruba, e ao olhar para tr\u00e1s v\u00ea que nenhum dos seus companheiros o seguiu. Ele come\u00e7a a chamar e ao ouvir uma resposta sai correndo em busca dela. A voz o leva para a entrada de um t\u00famulo e o chamar para as profundezas, ele diz que n\u00e3o mas seus p\u00e9s j\u00e1 n\u00e3o funcionam mais. Uma sombra com olhos brilhando o cerca e cai sobre ele, foi pego por uma cousa-tumulante. Ele acorda em baixo da terra, em um t\u00famulo, e ao olhar para o lado se depara com seus tr\u00eas companheiros, todos p\u00e1lidos, vestindo branco e com j\u00f3ias o adornando. Uma espada repousa sob seus pesco\u00e7os. Frodo tenta se acalmar e \u00e9 tomado por uma s\u00fabita coragem, vinda do fundo do seu \u00e2mago. Uma m\u00e3o come\u00e7a a rastejar em busca da espada em cima de Sam e Frodo rapidamente pega a espada em seu colo e desce contra o punho do bra\u00e7o rastejante, que solta um urro e some na escurid\u00e3o. Frodo ent\u00e3o se lembra da can\u00e7\u00e3o ensinada por Tom Bombadil para momentos de apuros. Estantes depois uma can\u00e7\u00e3o de resposta \u00e9 ouvida e uma rachadura na parede aos seus p\u00e9s \u00e9 aberto, onde Tom aparece.</p> <p>Tom tira Frodo e os hobbits do t\u00famulo, cantando uma can\u00e7\u00e3o que expulsa a cousa-tumular de l\u00e1. Um monte de tesouros \u00e9 resgatado por ele, e pega um broche de laz\u00fali para s\u00ed, dando de presente uma adaga em folha de ouro para os hobbits. Ele diz que foi feita pelos homens de ociente, que ca\u00edram perante o mago-bruxo de Angband, em Cairn Dun. Depois disso ele chama os p\u00f4neis dos hobbits pelo nome e eles v\u00eam enfileirados, com o de Tom liderando-os. Ele os guia at\u00e9 chegarem de volta na Estrada, e se despede deles com a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de seguirem at\u00e9 a cidade de Bri, onde a taverna P\u00f4nei Empinado \u00e9 comandada por um homem baixo e largo, o nobre Sr. Cevado Carrapicho.</p> <p>Bri \u00e9 uma cidadezinha onde o povo grande e o pequeno vive em harmonia. Os homens s\u00e3o mais baixos e parrudos, e dizem ser um povo antigo que viu o \u00eaxodo para o oeste e a sua volta para a terra m\u00e9dia. Se d\u00e3o bem com an\u00e3os, elfos e hobbits. Na taverna de Cevado Carrapicho os diferentes povos se reunem para trocar not\u00edcias. Estranhos guardi\u00f5es circundam as matas, protegendo as fronteiras, s\u00e3o descendentes dos reis de ociente e dizem que s\u00e3o capazes de se comunicar com aves e feras. S\u00e3o mais altos e morenos que os seus parentes do leste. L\u00e1 os hobbits chegam e se acomodam com uma farta ceia, decidem ent\u00e3o se juntar aos outros na taverna que est\u00e1 cheia.</p> <p>A companhia se reunia no sal\u00e3o principal da estalagem, onde uma grande lareira iluminava quase todos cantos enfuma\u00e7ados. Frodo estava observando quieto enquanto Sam e Pippin divertiam uma grande plateia. Pippin estava empolgado com a aten\u00e7\u00e3o e quase revelou sobre o desaparecimento de Bilbo, se n\u00e3o fosse Frodo e sua interven\u00e7\u00e3o. Um homem misterioso em um canto o chamou para conversar, era Passolargo, um Caminheiro que perambula pelas matas atento a todos os movimentos dos seres das redondezas. Ele alerta Frodo sobre Pippin e assim o hobbit decide de subito subir na mesa para tirar a aten\u00e7\u00e3o do seu primo. Com isso se v\u00ea obrigado a cantar alguma can\u00e7\u00e3o e assim se empolga com uma velha e tola m\u00fasica de Bilbo, at\u00e9 que escorrega da mesa e acaba colocando o anel no dedo, ou o anel que aproveitou e se colocou l\u00e1. De qualquer forma isso gerou espanto em todos e uma dupla de homens suspeitos se esgueira para fora do recinto.</p> <p>Passolargo acompanhou os hobbits de volta ao seu sal\u00e3o de estar. L\u00e1 ele pediu um momento com Frodo e explicou que j\u00e1 sabia sobre os Cavaleiros Negros, do Anel e do nome Bolseiro, e sugeriu que deveriam aceitar sua ajuda para a viagem que estava por vir. Em seguida Carrapicho entra e pede desculpas pela confus\u00e3o, e diz ter uma carta endere\u00e7ada a Frodo de Gandalf. A carta diz que deve ir imediatamente at\u00e9 Valfenda e que deve confiar em Passolargo, cujo nome \u00e9 Aragorn. Assim que eles est\u00e3o convencidos de que Passolargo \u00e9 um aliado chega Merry e Nob, o ajudante hobbit da taverna. Merry diz que saiu para tomar um ar e viu um estranho vulto sombrio conversando com algu\u00e9m, e depois n\u00e3o viu mais nada. Nob o encontrou do lado da casa de Bill Samambaia, um dos dois homens que sa\u00edram da taverna quando Frodo sumiu.</p> <p>No dia seguinte os hobbits encontram seus quartos revirados e com as camas cortadas. Seus p\u00f4neis tamb\u00e9m sumiram e com eles as suas provis\u00f5es. Enquanto isso na madrugada Fofo Bolger \u00e9 atormentado por vultos negros que rodeiam a casa de Frodo. Ele se esgueira pelos fundos e corre at\u00e9 a casa mais perto, que toca seu berrante e o seu aviso de que h\u00e1 inimigos nas terras-dos-buques. Com isso os cavaleiros fogem do Condado, agora cientes de que Bolseiro e o Anel n\u00e3o est\u00e3o ali. O assalto \u00e0 estalagem sabotou o plano de Passolargo de sair discretamente de Bri, e com isso um grande n\u00famero de pessoas veio v\u00ea-los partir pela Estrada. Bill Samambaia estava em cima da Sebe pr\u00f3ximo ao port\u00e3o zombando de Passolargo e dos hobbits, feliz por ter vendido um p\u00f4nei moribundo pelo triplo do pre\u00e7o a Frodo. Sam joga uma ma\u00e7\u00e3 que atinge em cheio p nariz do trambiqueiro. Depois de tr\u00eas dias confort\u00e1veis na estrada eles desviam e rumam para o leste a partir do p\u00e2ntano dos mosquitos, um lugar deveras desagrad\u00e1vel. Seu pr\u00f3ximo destino s\u00e3o as Colinas de Vento e o cume achatado do Topo-do-Vento, o pico mais ao sul e pr\u00f3ximo da Estrada, onde poder\u00e3o ter uma vis\u00e3o privilegiada de toda a regi\u00e3o.</p> <p>Depois de dias de caminhada chegam ao topo do vento. L\u00e1 encontram uma pedra com runas que podem indicar G3, um sinal de que Gandalf esteve ali no dia 03 de outubro. Frodo olha para a estrada ao oeste e v\u00ea cinco vultos negros se reunindo na estrada.</p> <p>No sop\u00e9 do monte eles montam acampamento e ouvem hist\u00f3rias de Passolargo sobre elfos e homens de outrora. Subitamente vultos negros surgem do topo da encosta, com um chiado congelante avan\u00e7am na dire\u00e7\u00e3o deles. Frodo sucumbe \u00e0 tenta\u00e7\u00e3o do Anel e o coloca no dedo. Ele v\u00ea os vultos negros mais nitidamente, com olhos brilhantes, elmos de prata e rosto cadav\u00e9rico. Ele saca sua espada e a v\u00ea brilhar vermelho como um ti\u00e7\u00e3o, e os cavaleiros param. Todos menos um, o maior com uma coroa que avan\u00e7a e ataca frodo com um punhal, ele se joga no ch\u00e3o e ataca o p\u00e9 do espectro, mas leva uma punhalada no ombro e desmaia.</p> <p>Frodo est\u00e1 com uma ferida mortal, seu ombro d\u00f3i, ele tem febre e sente muito frio. A fogueira improvisada ajuda, e o reagente que Passolargo prepara com uma planta do sul ajuda a estancar a ferida, mas o veneno fantasma continua assolando Frodo. Os cavaleiros-negros recuam e esperam enquanto Frodo luta contra a vontade deles de o dominarem. Passolargo ent\u00e3o os leva de imediato rumo ao Leste, passando por colinas e encostas arborizadas. O clima parece melhorar em um dia ensolarado onde eles passam pela floresta-dos-trolls e encontram os tr\u00eas amigos que foram petrificados por Gandalf e Bilbo h\u00e1 muito tempo atr\u00e1s. Depois de seguirem mais um pouco ao lado da Estrada, ouvem sons de cascos e uma esp\u00e9cie de sino. E se deparam com Glorfindel, da casa de Elrond. Ele diz que estava procurando eles e que recebeu not\u00edcias de que Os Nove os estavam ca\u00e7ando. Ele coloca Frodo no seu cavalo e os instiga a rumarem sem descanso at\u00e9 Valfenda.</p> <p>Chegando perto do vau do Bruinen eles ouvem o estridente grito dos espectros, quando quatro sombras surgem atr\u00e1s deles. O elfo instiga seu cavalo a levar Frodo em disparada para a ponte do outro lado do vau, e ao chegar perto um outro grito \u00e9 ouvido, quando outros quatro cavaleiros negros aparecem correndo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao hobbit e \u00e0 ponte do vau. O cavalo se esfor\u00e7a ao m\u00e1ximo para atravessar antes disso, e para olhando para os espectros. Frodo grita em desafio ao chamado deles e manda voltarem para Mordor. Eles riem e dizem que ele deveria voltar junto com eles e o Anel. Depois de instantes onde o l\u00edder deles avan\u00e7a em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a ponte um rugido de \u00e1gua \u00e9 ouvido, e o rio \u00e9 tomado por uma enxurrada de agua violenta onde cavalos brancos surfam as ondas e derrubam os espectros, levando eles pela correnteza violenta.</p> <p>Frodo acorda em Valfenda e se reencontra com Gandalf. Ele ainda est\u00e1 se recuperando da ferida da l\u00e2mina amaldi\u00e7oada. Gabdalf conta que ele estava quase desvanecendo e sucumbindo aos espectros do Anel. Mas Elrond \u00e9 um mestre na cura e conseguiu salvar o hobbit. Ent\u00e3o Frodo se levanta e \u00e9 recebido por um banquete em sua honra. L\u00e1 ele encontra Gl\u00f3in, um mestre an\u00e3o que participou da aventura de Bilbo \u00e0 montanha solit\u00e1ria. Ele conta como o valle e os homens de l\u00e1 triunfam sob a lideran\u00e7a dos Bardings. O filho de Baeorn, Grimbeorn \u00e9 o novo l\u00edder dos troca-peles e protegem a estrada entre eregion e o leste. Gl\u00f3in diz que est\u00e1 ali procurando conselho sobre Balin, que desapareceu. Depois disso Frodo encontra Bilbo, e os dois conversam sobre o condado e as aventuras que tiveram. Bilbo pede para ver o anel e por um momento parece se transformar em um ser magricelo e maligno com mal\u00edcia pelo anel.</p> <p>Frodo conversa com Bilbo at\u00e9 que chega Passolargo, a qual \u00e9 chamado de O D\u00fanadan por Bilbo e os elfos de valfenda. D\u00fanadan significa O Homem de Ociente, pois Aragorn \u00e9 N\u00famenoriano. Ele e Bilbo v\u00e3o para um canto, pois Bilbo pediu ajuda para terminar sua can\u00e7\u00e3o. Enquanto isso Frodo vai escorregando para um sonho onde fica ouvindo a m\u00fasica e os sons do sal\u00e3o ao seu redor. Durante o sonho Bilbo come\u00e7a a recitar uma poesia sobre Earendil.</p> <p>Frodo e Bilbo s\u00e3o convocados para o conselho de Elrond. L\u00e1 eles conhecem, Gimli filho de Gl\u00f3in, Legolas, filho do rei elfico de trevamata, Thranduil. E Boromir, filho do regente de Gondor, Denethor. L\u00e1 a hist\u00f3ria do anel \u00e9 contada, mas s\u00f3 depois dos convidados contarem o motivo da vinda at\u00e9 Valfenda. Gl\u00f3in diz que os an\u00e3os foram convencidos pelos seus a rumarem a partir da montanha solitaria ate moria. Boromir pede ajuda pois os homens est\u00e3 cedendo nas muralhas de Minas Tirith, a torre de vigia na fronteira entre Gondor e Mordor.</p> <p>O relato continua sobre a jornada do Anel. Gl\u00f3in conta que sauron ofereceu uma alian\u00e7a e os an\u00e9is dos an\u00e3os de volta caso ajudassem a achar o Um. Ele diz tamb\u00e9m que Balin partiu para Moria em busca do Anel perdido de Thror e n\u00e3o retornou mais, por isso pede aux\u00edlio. Gandalf diz que viajou at\u00e9 o Condado em busca de Frodo mas encontrou Radagast, O Marrom, no caminho, e ele trouxe not\u00edcias de que Nazg\u00fbl, Os Nove, estavam a solta. Saruman queria ver ele de pronto. Assim Gandalf se dirigiu at\u00e9 Isengard, e na torre de Orthanc foi aprisionado pela trai\u00e7\u00e3o de Saruman. Ele diz que a era dos Elfos acabou, e que os s\u00e1bios devem tomar o poder da Era dos Homens. Ele quer o Anel para s\u00ed, e se aliou com orcs e lobos para montar um ex\u00e9rcito paralelo escondido de Sauron. Gandalf foi aprisionado e depois salvo por Gwindor, senhor das \u00e1guias. Depois desse relato o Conselho pondera o que fazer a seguir. Muitos sugerem esconder o Anel, mas isso se mostrou imposs\u00edvel, ent\u00e3o Elrond decidiu que o melhor a se fazer \u00e9 destrui-lo, levando-o at\u00e9 Mordor e o jogando no vulc\u00e3o de Orodruin, a Montanha da Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>Boromir sugere que os homens de Gondor utilizem do anel ao inv\u00e9s de tentar destrui-lo. Elrond explica que o anel \u00e9 maligno e corrompe qualquer um que o usar, at\u00e9 aqueles s\u00e1bios e poderosos como Saruman, o Branco, que caso tivesse o Anel em m\u00e3os poderia ser capaz de destruir Sauron e tomar o seu lugar como o novo Senhor Sombrio. Depois de certa discuss\u00e3o Boromir aceita, e Bilbo se disp\u00f5e a ir como o cuidador do anel. Gandalf diz que ele j\u00e1 usou o anel de mais e que deveria ficar repousando. Com isso o silencio cai e s\u00f3 \u00e9 quebrado por Frodo, que tamb\u00e9m se propoe a ir. Elrond aceita e diz que ainda devem reunir mais 7 companheiros para fechar os 9, um para cada Nazg\u00fbl. Sam estava escondido e de pronto se voluntaria, e Gandalf tamb\u00e9m. Agora est\u00e3o esperando noticias e vendo quem mais deve ir. Elrond diz que cada representante das tr\u00eas ra\u00e7as devem ser representados. Assim \u00e9 formado a companhia do Anel, com Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Boromir e os dois hobbits, pippin e merry.</p> <p>A comitiva parte durante a noite por orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de Elrond. Eles passam diversas noites viajando para o sul, com as montanhas nevoentas ao leste. Chegam enfim at\u00e9 Azevim, ou Eregion como os elfos chamavam antigamente. L\u00e1 eles se deparam com um estranho sil\u00eancio, e uma revoada de corvos negros chamados cerbain, que supoem estarem os procurando a comando do Inimigo. Gandalf diz que o plano \u00e9 atravessar as montanhas por Caradhras, mas que devem pensar como fazer isso sem serem detectados pelas aves.</p> <p>Gandalf e Aragorn discutem sobre o caminho a seguir. Est\u00e3o receosos sobre subir Caradhras, O Cruel, onde o Port\u00e3o do Chifre-vermelho encima um pico branco de neve, por\u00e9m com rochas vermelho-sangue. Escalam o in\u00edcio da colina at\u00e9 os joelhos da montanha e s\u00e3o acossados com um forte vento e nevasca, incomum t\u00e3o abaixo do cume, o vento tem vozes mal\u00e9ficas sussurrando pragas. Est\u00e3o em d\u00favida sobre continuar ou irem pelo lugar ?escuro e secreto? que Gandalf e Aragorn discutem em segredo.</p> <p>A nevasca os cobre quase por completo, e apenas com o fogo m\u00e1gico de Gandalf uma fogueira \u00e9 acesa para derreter a neve e esquentar o grupo. No amanhecer decidem voltar e se deparam com o caminho bloqueado de neve. Aragorn e Boromir decidem eles mesmos cavarem a neve, e depois de alguns momentos voltam triunfantes. Na sa\u00edda a montanha ainda solta uma grande pedra de neve em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao penhasco nas costas deles, bloqueando o caminho. Entendendo a mensagem, os viajantes se dirigem para sua segunda op\u00e7\u00e3o: Moria.</p> <p>Descendo a montanha Gandalf decide montar acampamento em um c\u00edrculo de pedras, na colina onde eles se abrigaram na noite anterior. L\u00e1 sons agourentos de uivos eram constantemente ouvidos, e um s\u00fabito ataque de wargs foi silenciosamente planejado, depois que Legolas flechou o seu l\u00edder na garganta. Gandalf usa fogo, aragorn e boromir cortam os l\u00edderes com suas espadas, e o arco de Legolas canta. Depois de derrotarem os l\u00edderes, o restante lobos fogem. O amanhecer vem e com ele Gandalf percebe que os corpos dos lobos sumiram, e as flechas de Legolas est\u00e3o intactas, n\u00e3o eram wargs comuns. Se apressam ent\u00e3o a sair da montanha. Como que por desejo de uma for\u00e7a maior, a neve para de subito e o tempo abre, como se isso agora fosse mais interessante do que a nevasca do dia anterior. Eles ent\u00e3o avan\u00e7am at\u00e9 um penhasco escavado onde deveria ter uma porta para Moria.</p> <p>A comitiva chega a uma lagoa onde o rio sirannon foi represado. Eles a atravessam pelo norte e chegam em fim ao penhasco que cobre a porta secreta da montanha. No meio da muralha de pedra dois azevinheiros enormes montam guarda, e ali \u00e9 onde a porta secreta est\u00e1. Aquele lugar marca o fim do caminho entre Moria e Azevim, Eregion na lingua dos elfos de antigamente, que mantinham uma boa amizade com os an\u00e3os. Agora Gandalf se esfor\u00e7ava para fazer a porta abrir, mas nenhuma palavra parecia ser a correta. Uivos foram ouvidos de novo e um borbulhar sinistro vinha da lagoa, quando Boromir apavorado jogou uma pedra no meio dela, e Gandalf desmoronou nos pr\u00f3prios bra\u00e7os tentando pensar em algo. Quando os uivos e o borbulhar da agua estavam chegando cada vez mais perto Gandalf ri e diz que descobriu, e que na verdade a palavra secreta era Mellon, amigo em elfico. E que o segredo estava na pr\u00f3pria pista \"As portas de Durin, Senhor de Moria. Fala, amigo, e entra.\"</p> <p>Bem na hora que Gandalf p\u00f4s o p\u00e9 para dentro da Montanha, uma forma de tent\u00e1culo agarrou o p\u00e9 de Frodo, o derrubando. Vendo aquilo o pobre p\u00f4nei de Sam, Bill, se desespera e foge em disparada. Sam o deixa ir e chorando vai ao resgate de seu mestre Frodo. Ele corta o tent\u00e1culo com sua adaga e outros vinte surgem. Gandalf livra a todos do torpor e manda entrarem pelo portal. La dentro as serpentes do lago se debatem e acabam desabando as rochas no portal, selando os viajantes l\u00e1 dentro. O t\u00fanel escavado na pedra \u00e9 de muitas subidas e descidas na escurid\u00e3o, e depois de diversas marchas eles finalmente decidem descansar em um sal\u00e3o de festividades amplo e alto, com colunas de rocha ornamentada o sustentando.</p> <p>Frodo fica de vigia e parece ter visto dois pontos luminosos na escurid\u00e3o, parecendo olhos. No dia seguinte A comitiva avan\u00e7a seguindo feixes de luz at\u00e9 uma sala onde jaz uma grande l\u00e1pide branca. Em Runas de Daeron est\u00e1 escrito ?Balin filho de Fundin, Senhor de Moria?. Em um canto um livro velho e manchado \u00e9 encontrado, o livro de mazarbul, um di\u00e1rio com os \u00faltimos acontecimentos de Moria. L\u00e1 est\u00e1 relatado como Balin virou Senhor de Moria ao tentar recuperar os sal\u00f5es do controle dos orcs. Infelizmente ele levou um golpe por tr\u00e1s e pereceu, mas Ori continua o relato, e o seu desfecho \u00e9 de que a hoste de orcs encurralam os an\u00e3os, que perecem sem esperan\u00e7a. </p> <p>Ao se demorarem na Sala de Guarda um clamor come\u00e7a a ser ouvido, junto com guinchos e sons de muitos p\u00e9s. Uma enxurrada de orcs come\u00e7am a invadir e s\u00e3o barrados por Gandalf, mas no fim a comitiva precisa lutar e valorosamente Sam se destaca ao derrotar um dos inimigos. Pela selvageria da defesa os orcs fogem, mas o l\u00edder deles, um grande orc Uruk portando elmo e armadura negro adentra o sal\u00e3o, desviando e bloqueando os golpes de Boromir e Aragorn, e chegando por fim em Frodo, que \u00e9 perfurado no ombro esquerdo pela sua lan\u00e7a. Ele cai rente a parede e Aragorn o vinga abrindo o elmo do orc com sua espada. Gandalf manda eles aproveitarem a brecha e fugirem pela porta do leste, e Aragorn carrega Frodo com o pesar de que ele se foi. Gandalf fica para tr\u00e1s para barrar a persegui\u00e7\u00e3o e se depara com uma for\u00e7a n\u00e3o antes vista. Um fogo sombrio que quase vence a sua magia e o exaure at\u00e9 as \u00faltimas for\u00e7as.</p> <p>Frodo acorda e se recupera, para o espanto de todos. Ele n\u00e3o revela como isso aconteceu, mas sabe que foi devido ao colete de malha de mithril que Bilbo o deu. Mithril \u00e9 o metal mais precioso j\u00e1 encontrado na Terra M\u00e9dia, e s\u00f3 em Moria ele foi descoberto. An\u00e3os e elfos apreciavam como ele era resistente, male\u00e1vel e puro. Mas a sede por ele fez com que a Montanha fosse escavada de mais, resultando na ru\u00edna do povo de Durin em Khazad-d\u00fbm.</p> <p>Eles fogem em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a uma escadaria que corta um abismo em linha reta, sem prote\u00e7\u00e3o em nenhum dos lados. Flechas voam na sua dire\u00e7\u00e3o e o dum dum dos tambores \u00e9 incessante. Dois trols da montanha arremessam grandes pedras para que a hoste consiga passar, mas em seguida todos eles estremecem e se encolhem enquanto um ser sombrio de chamas surge entre eles. Em uma m\u00e3o um a\u00e7oite de brasas e na outra uma l\u00e2mina incandescente, o monstro \u00e9 um Balrog de Morgoth. Gandalf se prostra diante dele e conclama com o seu cajado \"Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode passar, chama de Ud\u00fbn, eu tenho o fogo de Anor, volte para as sombras!\". E assim, com uma parede branca de luz a ponte do abismo se rompe e com ela cai o dem\u00f4nio, mas n\u00e3o antes de la\u00e7ar as pernas do mago e o leva-lo consigo.</p> <p>Fugiram de Moria com pesar no cora\u00e7\u00e3o, pois Gandalf se foi. Eles descem o lago-espelho e passam pela Pedra de Durin, onde Gimli convida Frodo para dar uma olhada no vale ao redor. Mais em frente passam por uma ravina e deixar o lago para tr\u00e1s, chegando ent\u00e3o na beirada da floresta de Lothl\u00f3rien. Antes de entrarem Boromir est\u00e1 cauteloso e pergunta se realmente \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio, pois em Gondor ouviu estranhas hist\u00f3rias sobre aqueles que ali foram e nunca retornaram, ou que n\u00e3o voltaram ilesos. Aragorn o repreende e diz que s\u00f3 o inimigo deve temer lugar t\u00e3o belo e puro, pois ali habitam os Galadhrim, o povo \u00e9lfico da floresta. Eles se banham no riacho que conflui o rio Celebrant e o Nimrodel, e Legolas canta uma triste hist\u00f3ria sobre a elfa que deu nome ao rio, e como ela gostava de cantar por ali, at\u00e9 que sumiu depois que os an\u00e3os despertaram o mal sob a montanha.</p> <p>A comitiva decide descansar nas \u00e1rvores, por\u00e9m assim que Legolas se pendura no alto ramo da \u00e1rvore chamada Mellyrn, que s\u00f3 crescia naquela regi\u00e3o, um grito de aviso \u00e9 ouvido, em seguida Elfos surgem os saudando na sua l\u00edngua refinada. O l\u00edder deles \u00e9 Haldor, e ele diz que \u00e9 guardi\u00e3o daquelas partes, e os convida a subir na \u00e1rvore para conversarem. Legolas e Frodo sobem por uma corda at\u00e9 uma plataforma de madeira que forma um grande sal\u00e3o, com um eirado e um teto de folhas, ambiente que os elfos chamam de talan. L\u00e1 os hobbits passam a noite e dormem tranquilos. Durante a noite orcs passam em disparada, e frodo v\u00ea um vulto negro fungando e escalando a arvore. Dois olhos brilhando e olhando para ele se aproximam, mas em seguida somem e o vulto foge quando Haldor volta. No dia seguinte avan\u00e7am at\u00e9 o Naith, um lugar entre o rio Nimrodel e o Anduin, O Grande. L\u00e1 um morro chamado de Amroth surge e a comitiva \u00e9 levada, primeiramente vendada e depois em liberdade. Pois os Elfos desconfiam do an\u00e3o Gimli, e esse se recusa a aceitar ser levado vendado. Aragorn resolve sugerindo que todos sejam vendados.</p> <p>Eles chegam em Cerim Amroth, uma cidade circulada por \u00e1rvores brancas e sem folhas, onde no meio os talan rodeiam um eirado alto. Todos ficam maravilhados e frodo parece sentir o vento sul como aquele que vem do mar, com o som das \u00e1guas e o canto dos p\u00e1ssaros.</p> <p>Haldir os guia at\u00e9 Caras Galadhon, A Cidade das \u00c1rvores. L\u00e1 eles conhecem o Sr e a Sra \u00e9lficos, Galadriel e Celeborn. A sra os esquadrinha e os testa para ver se s\u00e3o verdadeiros a causa. Depois passam v\u00e1rios dias l\u00e1, descansando e se recuperando. Legolas e Gimli se tornam amigos e Frodo faz uma m\u00fasica para Gandalf, quando o pesar de todos aumenta.</p> <p>Galadriel convida os hobbits para observarem o seu Espelho, onde \u00e9 revelado o que foi, o que \u00e9 e o que pode ser. Sam v\u00ea o Condado sendo escavado e destru\u00eddo por constru\u00e7\u00f5es. Frodo v\u00ea Gandalf de branco vagando por um deserto, e Bilbo concentrado por voltas de papeis. No fim v\u00ea o Olho de Sauron, e o anel subitamente se torna pesado. Galadriel diz que sabe do que se trata e mostra que ela est\u00e1 com um dos Tr\u00eas, o de diamante, e conta como a destrui\u00e7\u00e3o do Um significa o minguar dos elfos de Lothl\u00f3rien, restando a eles irem para o oeste ou se reduzirem at\u00e9 o esquecimento. Mas isso todos est\u00e3o satisfeitos, pois \u00e9 melhor que serem subjazidos por Sauron</p> <p>Chega a hora de se despedirem de L\u00f3rien, e recebem barcos para a viagem ao sul, com capas \u00e9lficas feitas pela pr\u00f3pria Galadriel e suas seguidoras. Para cada um dos companheiros ela deu uma d\u00e1diva, primeiramente a Aragorn, que recebeu uma bainha para sua espada lend\u00e1ria, onde runas \u00e9lficas conclamavam o seu nome: And\u00faril. Al\u00e9m disso deu a ele um colar com uma j\u00f3ia esmeralda em forma de cisne, um presente que era da filha de Galadriel, Celebr\u00edan, e depois da filha dela, Arwen Vespestrela.</p> <p>Para o jardineiro Sam, Galadriel d\u00e1 uma caixinha de madeira, com terra de L\u00f3rien. Para boromir, um cinto de espada dourado. Para Pippin e Merry, um cinto de prata com o broche como uma folha, e para Legolas, um arco galadhrim, com corda de cabelo-\u00e9lfico. Ela pergunta o que o An\u00e3o Gimli deseja, e ele diz que n\u00e3o quer nada, apenas, j\u00e1 que ela perguntou, comentar que o seu desejo era uma mecha do cabelo dourado dela, que ele guardaria como o mais precioso tesouro de sua fam\u00edlia, e representaria a amizade entre caverna e floresta. Ela ent\u00e3o lhe d\u00e1 tr\u00eas fios do seu cabelo. Por fim, para Frodo ela d\u00e1 um frasco com a luz da estrela de Earendil, para brilhar e iluminar quando todo o resto falhar. Assim a companhia segue rumo ao sul pelo rio Veio-de-Prata e em seguida pelo Grande Rio, o Anduin, todos lamentando profundamente a despedida daquela terra de sonhos onde mesmo no inverno e no crep\u00fasculo do tempo ainda \u00e9 bela.</p> <p>A comitiva desce o Anduin durante as noites e descansa durante os dias. Uma semana se passa sem grandes eventos, apenas a paisagem mudando e indo de florestas para pradarias no oeste, e descampados rochosos no leste, e um vulto que os segue tentando se aproximar durante as noites, Gollum, que vem nos seus encal\u00e7os desde Moria. Durante a oitava noite o rio fica mais largo e raso, e subitamente violento quando ele volta a afunilar ao se aproximarem do vale da Queda de Rauros. Eles conseguem conter o s\u00fabito avan\u00e7o, mas logo em seguida orcs surgem varando-os com flechas. Eles se protegem e impulsionam os barcos, finalmente se livrando do perigo quando o rio volta a se alargar e assim podem descansar na margem oeste.</p> <p>Ao pararem na margem oeste um grande vulto negro sobrevoa vindo do sul. Legolas faz cantar seu arco elfico e atinge a besta, que cai com um guinchado lamuriento na escurid\u00e3o. Os orques que comemoravam a vinda do vulto se calaram e n\u00e3o mais foram vistos ou ouvidos. O resto da viagem prosseguiu sem inoportunos, e a comitiva foi por rio e terra passando pela ravina e os penhascos de Emyn Muil, passando pelos Pilares-dos-Reis onde gigantescas est\u00e1tuas de Isildur e An\u00e1rion advertem aqueles que desejam passagem por motivos malignos. Depois passam pelos montes de Rauros e ali descidem parar, pois n\u00e3o podem avan\u00e7ar mais sem antes decidir um caminho.</p> <p>A comitiva decide descansar no morro ao oeste da queda de Rauros, e ali perguntam para Frodo qual caminho ele decidir\u00e1 tomar. O hobbit est\u00e1 aflito e parte sozinho para pensar. Na verdade sabe qual caminho deve tomar, mas tem medo de admitir e se preocupa com seus companheiros. Todos deixam com que ele v\u00e1 sozinho, mas Sam percebe como Boromir parece seguir o hobbit com o olhar. Depois de alguns momentos pensando sozinho e olhando para o leste a partir de uma clareira, Frodo se assusta ao perceber Boromir se aproximando com um sorriso gentil no rosto. </p> <p>O gondoriano diz querer aconselhar Frodo, e que ele pode livr\u00e1-lo do Fardo. Frodo percebe que Boromir est\u00e1 com um olhar sedento e se apavora com a constante ladainha que o homem come\u00e7a a fazer ao conversar consigo mesmo de como \u00e9 est\u00fapido a ideia de destruir um objeto t\u00e3o poderoso. No fim ele ataca Frodo com desejo de obter o Anel, e o hobbit se v\u00ea obrigado a coloc\u00e1-lo no dedo para assim poder escapar. Ele sobe at\u00e9 o topo do monte e de l\u00e1 senta numa grande cadeira de pedra, utilizada antigamente pelos vigias daqueles passos. L\u00e1 ele observa Trevamata no norte, as montanhas nevoentas no leste, Gondor e Minas Tirith no sul, e finalmente Mordor e a torre de Barad-dur, a fortaleza de Sauron, com o olho que parece perseguindo-o. </p> <p>Frodo toma coragem e decide partir sozinho em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao leste, rumando assim para os barcos. Enquanto isso, Boromir retorna e relata como encontrou Frodo, e como o mesmo fugiu dele colocando o Anel. Um s\u00fabito desespero e loucura toma conta da Comitiva, e todos partem para uma dire\u00e7\u00e3o atr\u00e1s do hobbit. Aragorn manda Boromir seguir Merry e Pippin e proteger os jovens, como repara\u00e7\u00e3o pelo mal que causou. Sam entende a mente do seu senhor e vai para os barcos, onde se junta a Frodo e o convence a lev\u00e1-lo consigo. O livro acabo com os amigos rumando para o leste.</p>"},{"location":"lore/tolkien/lord-of-rings-2/","title":"O Senhor dos An\u00e9is - As Duas Torres","text":"<p>Aragorn escuta a trompa de Boromir soar dentre os urros dos orcs. Muitas vezes ela berrou com os gritos dos malignos, at\u00e9 que n\u00e3o mais foi ouvida. Numa clareira o alvo homem de Gondor estava encostado numa \u00e1rvore, como se descansava, mas com muitas flechas negras em seu corpo. Confessou a Aragorn que tentou tirar o Anel de Frodo, e pagara por isso. Protegeu os hobbits Merry e Pippin, e mais de 20 corpos estavam aos seus p\u00e9s. Mas ainda assim os dois foram levados. Fizeram um funeral para o bravo companheiro, e no Anduin colocaram seu corpo com seus pertences e todas as armas \u00f3rquicas derrotadas. Por fim decidiram resgatar os hobbits capturados ao inv\u00e9s de tentarem encontrar Sam e Frodo.</p> <p>A comitiva segue a trilha dos orcs e encontra uma pilha de corpos na estrada. Pelo visto houve desaven\u00e7as entre os orcs de Mordor, das montanhas nevoentas e aqueles de Saruman, os maiores e mais fortes Urukais.</p> <p>Os ca\u00e7adores seguem a trilha dos orques rumo ao oeste e entram nos pastos de Rohan. Descobrem pistas de passos de hobbit e um broche de L\u00f3rien. Isso os d\u00e1 esperan\u00e7a. Correm o dia todo e na noite est\u00e3o em d\u00favida sobre descansar ou seguirem pela noite. No fim, Aragorn decide descansar.</p> <p>O trio segue a persegui\u00e7\u00e3o descansando pouco e gra\u00e7as ao p\u00e3o-dos-elfos, o lembas, conseguem se recuperar sem parar e assim fazem avan\u00e7o, mas ainda assim sentem-se fracos e lentos, onde os orcs parecem n\u00e3o parar e sempre seguirem firmes. Isso s\u00f3 poderia ser uma maquina\u00e7\u00e3o de Saruman, e eles mais uma vez perdem a esperan\u00e7a de encontrarem os hobbits antes da chegada a Isengard. Pr\u00f3ximos da floresta de Fangorn eles se deparam com uma regi\u00e3o pisoteada onde os orcs descansaram, por\u00e9m, sem sinal dos pequeninos. Em seguida, Legolas v\u00ea se aproximarem cavaleiros de Rohan.</p> <p>Cavaleiros de Rohan se aproximam e v\u00e3o interpelar os tr\u00eas vultos cinzentos em vestes estranhas. \u00c9omer, filho de \u00c9omund e terceiro marechal dos cavaleiros de Rohan relata que mataram os orques e n\u00e3o viram sinal dos hobbits. Aragorn teve que se declarar o herdeiro de Isildur para ser respeitado pelos cavaleiros desconfiados</p> <p>Aragorn e os outros recebem cavalos para continuarem sua busca. Conversando com \u00c9omer descobrem que Rohan n\u00e3o paga tributo a Sauron, mas palavras covardes s\u00e3o sussurradas ao rei Th\u00e9odred sobre alian\u00e7a com Sauron e Saruman, e contra o trai\u00e7oeiro mago Gandalf. Saruman tomou para si o controle da Marca e ataca com grandes Orcs, monta-lobos e outras criaturas. Aragorn encontra a grande pira de orcs mortos, na beira da floresta de Fangorn. L\u00e1 Gimli fica com a primeira vigia, e se depara com um vulto curvado e de chap\u00e9u longo e mantos brancos, que some do nada e espanta os cavalos Rohirrim. No pr\u00f3ximo cap\u00edtulo retoma-se a hist\u00f3ria de Pippin e Merry, e de como os orques brigam entre si, questionando a lealdade deles a Saruman e resultando em mortes daqueles que ousaram desafiar os Urukai.</p> <p>Os orcs brigam entre si sobre qual caminho tomar e pippin aproveita para cortar sua corta e continuar disfar\u00e7ando em seguida. Eles sabem que os cavaleiros da marca os est\u00e3o perseguindo, e por isso dobram a marcha e avan\u00e7am inclusive durante o dia. Merry e Pippin recebem uma bebida nojenta, mas que livra sua dor e os da energia. Agora pr\u00f3ximos de Fangorn, a floresta velha, o l\u00edder dos urukai, Ugluk, manda os receosos do norte embora, e depois os v\u00ea retornarem.</p> <p>Os orcs correm em grande marcha e se desesperam ao ver que longe no leste cavaleiros se aproximam. Eles se re\u00fanem num morrinho e ali montam acampamento enquanto a noite perdura sombria. Durante as \u00faltimas horas de escurid\u00e3o os cavaleiros atacam sorrateiramente enquanto os orcs esperam refor\u00e7os vindos do oeste sob a floresta. Pippin e Merry s\u00e3o deixados sem prote\u00e7\u00e3o por alguns momentos, mas n\u00e3o conseguem fazer nada antes de Grishn\u00e1k surgir e os levar para longe. O orc de Mordor conversa com eles e os tateia no escuro. Pippin logo percebe a inten\u00e7\u00e3o do gobelin, encontrar O Anel entre os seus pertences. Ele ent\u00e3o come\u00e7a a logr\u00e1-lo para solt\u00e1-los em troca do tesouro. E assim o convence a fugir com eles s\u00f3 para si. Mas n\u00e3o consegue ir muito longe antes de ser assomado por um grande cavalo-de-guerra, que o trespassa com flechas enquanto ele tenta desembainhar sua espada. Assim merry e pippin s\u00e3o esquecidos e passam despercebidos, deitados e cobertos pelas suas capas \u00e9lficas. Eles comem os restos dos seus Lembas, os p\u00e3es-\u00e9lficos, e partem despreocupadamente em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 floresta de Fangorn, enquanto ouvem trompas e gritos de guerra dos homens de Rohan que ganham vida com a chegada da aurora.</p> <p>Merry e Pippin se enredam dentro da floresta de Fangorn. A floresta \u00e9 velha, com \u00e1rvores enormes cobertas por barbas de l\u00edquen e cip\u00f3s. Est\u00e3o famintos e com sede, e decidem escalar uma \u00e1rvore para beberem de uma pequena cascata que desce do rio Ent\u00e1gua. Eles se sentem revigorados assim que terminam de tomar e partem mais adentro conversando sobre o que fazer. Encontram uma regi\u00e3o onde os raios de sol chegam at\u00e9 eles e ali decidem escalar o monte para verem onde est\u00e3o. L\u00e1 em cima percebem que avan\u00e7aram poucas milhas para dentro da floresta, e quando debatem o que fazer escutam uma voz grave e lenta respondendo-os. Era um Ent, um ser alto como um gigante, human\u00f3ide, por\u00e9m com casca de \u00e1rvore ao inv\u00e9s de pele, e uma longa barba branca de cip\u00f3s e \u00e1rvores. Fangorn \u00e9 conhecido, ou Barb\u00e1rvore na l\u00edngua comum, e ele se v\u00ea curioso com aqueles dois pequenos seres ali presentes. Conversam longamente sobre o nome das coisas e not\u00edcias do mundo de fora, e s\u00e3o levados pelo Ent para mais dentro da floresta onde ele promete comida e bebida para deix\u00e1-los mais fortes.</p> <p>O ent leva os hobbits at\u00e9 o sop\u00e9 da montanha nevoenta dentro de Fangorn. L\u00e1 o rio Ent\u00e1gua escorre de sua nascente em uma gruta alta e cercada por \u00e1rvores. A \u00e1gua pinga em uma grande tigela de pedra, e ao tomar os hobbits sentem o frescor e a tranquilidade de uma mata de longe dali, e a partir dos dedos dos p\u00e9s at\u00e9 os fios dos cabelos uma for\u00e7a os revigora. Barbarvore ent\u00e3o pede para eles contarem toda sua hist\u00f3ria, sobre o condado, Elrond e Valfenda, mas principalmente Gandalf e Saruman. Gandalf \u00e9 considerado o \u00fanico que realmente se importa com as \u00e1rvores, j\u00e1 Saruman era antes um aliado que agora as derruba para alimentar os fogos de Orthanc. Barbarvore diz que n\u00e3o pode mais ignorar a amea\u00e7a do mago branco, e resolve montar um conselho para alistar os ents a sua causa.</p> <p>Barb\u00e1rvore convoca o Entencontro no Valarcano, uma grande clareira em depress\u00e3o c\u00f4ncava onde os mais variados ents se encontraram. Alguns eram altos como Barb\u00e1rvore, outros eram menos e castanhos, outros mais altos e cinzentos, todos com os mesmos olhos amarelos e atentos. Come\u00e7aram um canto lento e arrastado em sua pr\u00f3pria l\u00edngua, e depois de algum tempo Barb\u00e1rvore se dirigiu aos hobbits dizendo que estavam livres para rumar pela floresta enquanto eles conversavam. Iria demorar ainda muitos dias antes que a conversa lenta dos ents chegasse ao fim. Ficaram aos cuidados de Bregalad, um ent jovem e inteligente que teve o seu jardim destru\u00eddo pelos orcs, e que era mais \"apressado\" que a maioria, e por isso j\u00e1 tinha se decidido a seguir Barb\u00e1rvore contra Isengard. Eles passaram dias passeando e cantando e rindo com Bregolad, e dormiram na sua casa-de-ent, uma pedra grande como uma ribanceira, onde um filete da \u00e1gua do rio descia. Por fim, ap\u00f3s dias, um sil\u00eancio tomou conta da floresta. De s\u00fabito sons de tambor foram ouvidos, e o farfalhar das folhas anunciava a aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o dos ents. Eles se decidiram e estavam agitados, furiosos com Isengard e a trai\u00e7\u00e3o do mago Saruman, e assim partiram cantando e ribombando em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao sudoeste.</p> <p>Aragorn descobre o que aconteceu com os hobbits e os orcs que os capturaram. Segue as pistas at\u00e9 a pedra onde eles encontraram Barb\u00e1rvore e ali se deparam com um vulto branco e cinzento, um anci\u00e3o com um cajado que o segura. Os tr\u00eas companheiros ficam de prontid\u00e3o, mas descobrem que \u00e9 Gandalf, que agora retorna como O Branco. Ele explica que os hobbits est\u00e3o com os Ents em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a Isengard e que eles devem ir at\u00e9 Rohan ajudar Th\u00e9oden.</p> <p>Gandalf conta como caiu junto do Balrog at\u00e9 o fundo da montanha, onde seres antigos e inominados vagam. O Balrog foi por t\u00faneis esquecidos at\u00e9 as grandes escadarias de Moria, e de l\u00e1 para uma janela no alto que dava para o sol l\u00e1 fora. No pico da montanha lutaram e Gandalf venceu. Foi mandado de volta para terminar sua miss\u00e3o, e depois de algum tempo no frio ele foi salvo por Gwaihir, o lorde das \u00e1guias. Ficou em Lothl\u00f3rien por um tempo e l\u00e1 se recuperou. Em seguida partiu para Fangorn.</p> <p>Gandalf chama Scadufax, seu cavalo branco e um dos Maeras, senhores dos cavalos. Com ele est\u00e3o os outros dois cavalos dados por \u00c9omer a Aragorn e Legolas. Eles cavalgam sem parar at\u00e9 o pa\u00e7o de Eredas, a fortaleza do rei Th\u00e9odred. L\u00e1 s\u00e3o recebidos com suspeita e desconfian\u00e7a, e Gandalf se dirige ao rei no seu sal\u00e3o. A cidade tem cal\u00e7adas de pedra e est\u00e1 encimada no topo de uma colina onde escorre a \u00e1gua do riacho da neve. O sal\u00e3o est\u00e1 numa sacada com jardim onde uma bacia faz jorrar a \u00e1gua do rio a partir de uma pedra escavada como uma cabe\u00e7a de cavalo. O sal\u00e3o tem colunas altas e esculpidas, com tape\u00e7arias nas paredes representando Eorl, o jovem guerreiro do norte que desceu com seu cavalo branco para fundar o pa\u00eds de Rohan. Em degraus de pedra um grande trono est\u00e1 posto, com uma dama de p\u00e9 do lado e um homem velho e encurvado sentado. Um homem est\u00e1 sentado no degrau mais baixo, e ele parece p\u00e1lido e com um olhar zombeteiro e agudo. \u00c9 Gr\u00edma, o l\u00edngua de cobra, e gandalf precisa venc\u00ea-lo no discurso antes de conseguir se dirigir ao rei, que parece enfeiti\u00e7ado pelas palavras do venenoso conselheiro. Por fim gandalf consegue fazer o antigo rei voltar a si ao leva lo para sentir o sol e o ar fora do seu sal\u00e3o, e ao empunhar novamente sua espada.</p> <p>O rei se livra de Gr\u00edma e convoca todo seu povo para a guerra. Deixa \u00c9owin, filha de sua irm\u00e3 como regente de Meduseld, e parte com seu cavalo e Gandalf, agora senhor-da-marca e mestre do cavalo Scadufax, que antes lhe tinha sido apenas emprestado. Gr\u00edma foi posto em liberdade e fugiu ap\u00f3s cuspir no ch\u00e3o a frente do rei.</p> <p>Os cavaleiros de Rohan se dirigem para o desfiladeiro de helm. Uma fortaleza de pedra erguida numa grota funda dentro das montanhas brancas. L\u00e1 \u00e9 feito o \u00faltimo levante contra as hostes de isengard. Uma enxurrada de orcs e homens do norte avan\u00e7am contra o port\u00e3o de pedra e s\u00e3o recha\u00e7ados por Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas e os homens de Th\u00e9oden. Gandalf disse que um assunto urgente o aguardava e disparou com Scadufax para o norte. Pelos maquin\u00e1rios de Saruman bombas explodiam os port\u00f5es e os orcs avan\u00e7avam. Mas com a aurora chegando Th\u00e9oden mandou que soasse a grande trombeta que encimava o Forte-da-Trombeta no sop\u00e9 da grota, e pelo som que ecoava no abismo todos estremeceram. Ent\u00e3o surgiu o rei e Aragorn galopando em investida, e os orca retrocederam. Ao olharem para tr\u00e1s, uma floresta negra de s\u00fabito se erguia nas suas costas, para o desespero dos orcs em fuga. Dali surge o cavaleiro branco Gandalf e o l\u00edder do Helm, Erkenwald de Westfolde, e a sua tropa.</p> <p>O rei Th\u00e9oden e os demais da comitiva do Anel se encontram novamente com Gandalf e a sinistra floresta que ele trouxa consigo. Ele ent\u00e3o diz que est\u00e1 indo para Isengard e que o Rei deveria ir com ele. Ao partirem rumo ao oeste eles passam pelas \u00e1rvores e, para o espanto dos Homens, v\u00eaem os Ents se dirigindo de volta em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Fangorn. Mais ao oeste eles passam pelo Vau do Isen e l\u00e1 descobrem que o rio antes volumoso est\u00e1 agora seco, alguma obra maligna de Saruman. Uma n\u00e9voa negra e aterrorizante os cerca, mas Gandalf os mant\u00e9m firmes.</p> <p>De s\u00fabito eles ouvem o rugido do rio e a volta da sua correnteza. Avan\u00e7ando para um longo bra\u00e7o da montanha eles chegam no Vau do Mago, onde os port\u00f5es de Isengard se prostram irreverentes. Antes um lugar verdejante de saber e cultivo, feito pelos Homens de Ociente em eras passadas como um baluarte de Gondor no oeste, agora pelas m\u00e3os de Saruman se tornou um antro de ferro e fogo, uma r\u00e9plica mesquinha da torre de Mordor onde o mal repousa, Barad-d\u00fbr. Mas agora Gandalf e as tropas de Rohan encontram o lugar devastado e destru\u00eddo, e para a sua surpresa dois seres pequeninos em trajes cinzentos se encontram deitados na frente da grande torre de Orthanc, com uma variedade de comidas e vinho, soltando an\u00e9is de fuma\u00e7a azul de um cachimbo. Era Merry e Pippin, guardando a entrada para saudar os companheiros que chegaram.</p> <p>Merry e pippin contam como os ents cercaram Isengard e como os Huorns, ents quase arvores que se movem sorrateiramente e odeiam os orcs, estavam presentes. Eles vieram falar com Saruman e foram recebidos com flechas e pedras. Ficaram enfurecidos e come\u00e7aram a destruir pedra e ferro com suas raizes e vozes retumbantes. Depois liberaram as \u00e1guas do Isen e ela fluiu pelo pa\u00e7o da torre. Gandalf aparece com pressa e fala com Barb\u00e1rvore sobre 10 mil orcs em Rohan, ele ent\u00e3o manda os Huorns ajudarem o mago.</p> <p>Merry termina o seu relato contando como Gr\u00edma aparece e \u00e9 largado com Saruman, agora Gandalf deve confrontar o mago, mas adverte a todos contra o poder da sua voz.</p> <p>Saruman tenta convencer Th\u00e9oden pelas suas palavras doces e enfeiti\u00e7adas. Mas ele n\u00e3o cai, e resiste \u00e0 tenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus eng\u00f4dos. Num \u00faltimo esfor\u00e7o tenta convencer Gandalf, que apenas ri das suas tentativas e diz para ele sair da torre, mas ele se enfurece e manda eles irem embora. Por\u00e9m Gandalf \u00e9 que manda sua palavra de comando, e quebra o cajado de Saruman, tirando dele seu t\u00edtulo de Mago Branco do Conselho. Logo em seguida um grande objeto cai de uma janela superior, quase acertando Saruman e Gandalf logo abaixo. Foi Gr\u00edma, que errou por n\u00e3o conseguir decidir quem odiava mais.</p> <p>O grande objeto era uma bola de cristal negra e reluzente. Pippin a pega antes que ela caia em uma po\u00e7a, e Gandalf a recolhe em seguida. Eles partem de Isengard e montam acampamento para descansarem antes da viagem ao sul. Pippin n\u00e3o consegue dormir e se sente aflito e impelido \u00e0 esfera, que rouba de Gandalf e a observa profundamente. Uma vis\u00e3o do olho de mordor invade sua mente e fala com ele, o deixando at\u00f4nito e apavorado. Gandalf ent\u00e3o descobre que a esfera \u00e9 uma Pallantir, uma obra muito antiga que era usada pelos homens de Ociente para se comunicarem e observarem a longas dist\u00e2ncias. Agora Sauron sabe sobre Pippin e envia seus cavaleiros negros montados em grandes montarias voadoras. Gandalf decide partir imediatamente com Pippin e a esfera, voando em cima de Scadufax em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a Gondor.</p> <p>A esfera tornou pippin obsessivo e ele a tocou se conectando com Sauron. Ele enviou um nazgul em um monstro alado para verificar e com isso Gandalf e Pippin partiram em disparada para o sul com Scadufax. Frodo e Sam est\u00e3o tentando vencer as Emyn Muil e ir para o leste, mas os morros s\u00e3o trai\u00e7oeiros.</p> <p>Ao passar o vulto do nazg\u00fbl por coma deles e dar o seu grito congelante, Frodo cai durante a descida do precip\u00edcio em que estavam. Ele n\u00e3o se machuca, pois cai logo abaixo e \u00e9 jogado pelo vento contra a parede de pedra. Mas acaba ficando cego pela escurid\u00e3o. Sam acha estranho, pois ele consegue ainda ver seu mestre, mas chama por ele e exclama ao se lembrar de que ainda tem corda \u00e9lfica de L\u00f3rien. Ele joga para Frodo que consegue voltar a ver o seu brilho prateado. Em seguida a tempestade parece passar, quando o Olho volta sua maldade para Gondor e Rohan, e assim os dois hobbits conseguem descer o penhasco com ajuda da sua corda \u00e9lfica.</p> <p>Sam percebe dois pontos brilhantes na parede do penhasco, era gollum, descendo como uma aranha em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao sop\u00e9. Eles esperam escondidos e conseguem captur\u00e1-lo ao terminar de descer. Frodo faz ele jurar pelo anel que vai ajud\u00e1-los a ir para Mordor. Eles tentam amarr\u00e1-lo com a corda \u00e9lfica, mas ele agoniza de dor pelo seu toque.</p> <p>Os hobbits seguem gollum por um sulco baixo at\u00e9 chegarem aos loda\u00e7ais do p\u00e2ntano dos mortos. L\u00e1 eles avan\u00e7am lentamente entre os charcos trai\u00e7oeiros, enquanto gollum os guia sempre em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao leste. Sam continua suspeito do seu guia, mas Smeagol se mostrou amistoso e Frodo garante que ele n\u00e3o tentar\u00e1 nada por enquanto. O anel parece que fica cada vez mais pesado quanto mais pr\u00f3ximo ele est\u00e1 de Mordor, e Frodo est\u00e1 na beira da exaust\u00e3o. O p\u00e2ntano escuro surge luzes bruxuleantes na dist\u00e2ncia, lanternas dos mortos, diz gollum, e alerta sobre os rostos mortos nas po\u00e7as, que os atrai de forma hipnotizante. As n\u00e9voas se dissipam e um guincho agudo \u00e9 ouvido quando um dos nazgul passa sobre eles na sua montaria alada.</p> <p>Os hobbits chegam \u00e0 terra desolada na frente de Mordor. L\u00e1 nada cresce al\u00e9m de cinzas, e o port\u00e3o de Morannon se eleva na entrada para a terra das sombras. Smeagol diz que sabe de um caminho mais secreto e que eles n\u00e3o devem ir pelo port\u00e3o, pois estariam entregando o anel ao senhor sombrio.</p> <p>Chegam enfim ao port\u00e3o de mordor e se desesperam com o poderio e as paredes impenetraveis. Sam est\u00e1 decidido a seguir seu mestre Sr. Frodo para dentro de mordor se for necess\u00e1rio, mas Smeagol se desespera e suplica para n\u00e3o irem. Fala assim de outro caminho mais escondido e mais escuro que pode lev\u00e1-los para dentro.</p> <p>Sam e frodo seguem gollum depois dele convenc\u00ea-los de um caminho melhor. Ele descreve um caminho secreto, por uma escadaria oculta ao lado de minas morgul, a antiga torre da lua dos homens de gondor. Para isso eles se viraram para o sul, descendo pela estrada de Ithilien \u00e0 direita das montanhas sombrias. Era uma regi\u00e3o muito florida com sinais de primavera, e ap\u00f3s longas caminhadas eles seguiram um riacho que desaguava em um lago acima de uma bacia de pedra. L\u00e1 eles se lavaram e foram descansar, e sam decidiu cozinhar coelhos que smeagol tinha ca\u00e7ado. Ap\u00f3s comerem um ensopado Sam foi lavar seus utens\u00edlios de cozinha quando percebe uma fuma\u00e7a azul subindo ao sol, era sua fogueira que antes estava oculta mas que agora se alastrava por outras plantas.</p> <p>Logo os dois amigos come\u00e7am a ouvir vozes se aproximando. S\u00e3o surpreendidos por grandes vultos de homens com roupas verdes e cinzentas, portando lan\u00e7as e arcos longos. Eram os caminheiros de Ithilien, liderados por Faramir. Os d\u00fanedain do sul foram enviados de Gondor para proteger suas matas orientais, e ca\u00e7avam os orques e homens do sul que ali passavam. Faramir quis saber mais sobre Boromir, o seu antigo capit\u00e3o, e depois de Frodo contar um pouco da sua hist\u00f3ria ele se despediu dos hobbits e saiu. Em momentos um clamor de batalha foi ouvido, e um retumbar de ch\u00e3o fez com que Sam fosse atra\u00eddo para uma vis\u00e3o de sonhos, um grande Olifante passava por ele, com focinho comprido, grandes presas empinadas e uma esp\u00e9cie de torre de vigia nas costas, com um sulista min\u00fasculo e apavorado o guiando sem muito \u00eaxito.</p> <p>O l\u00edder dos homens era Faramir, irm\u00e3o de Boromir de Gondor. Ele indaga sobre a ru\u00edna de isildur e pergunta com desconfian\u00e7a a hist\u00f3ria de Frodo e da comitiva. Ele estava se aproximando da verdade sobre o Anel, mas foi cauteloso e se mostrou mais s\u00e1bia e de cora\u00e7\u00e3o menos orgulhoso do que boromir, mesmo n\u00e3o sendo suficiente para frodo confessar o que \u00e9 a sina. Faramir ent\u00e3o convida (ou exige) que os hobbits o sigam para um esconderijo onde possam conversar com mais privacidade enquanto as estradas se acalmam depois dos ataques de Gondor contra os homens de Harad vindos do sul. Eles concordam em segui-lo vendo que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 como seguiram viagem com as estradas turbulentas. Assim se deparam em uma caverna coberta por uma cascata onde os homens fizeram seu esconderijo. Henneth Annun \u00e9 o seu nome, A Cascata do Poente.</p> <p>Sam e Frodo conversam com Faramir depois de um belo desjejum. Frodo conta hist\u00f3rias da comitiva sem ir para o lado da ruina de isildur, mas depois de ouvir Faramir falar Sam acaba vacilando e contando sobre O Um Anel. O Gondolin se mostrou virtuoso e n\u00e3o quis saber nem tentou nada ao descobrir sobre o Precioso, e finalmente entendeu o verdadeiro desejo de seu irm\u00e3o Boromir, que tentou pegar o Anel a for\u00e7a e isso foi a sua perdi\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>Faramir acorda Frodo para conversarem e mostra para ele uma lagoa secreta onde um vulto est\u00e1 se aproximando devagar. Era o gollum Smeagol, que s\u00f3 n\u00e3o foi abatido a pedido de Frodo. Depois de negociar com Faramir eles conseguem capturar a criatura e o trouxeram diante do chefe dos mateiros. Faramir o questiona por onde estava levando os hobbits e assim descobre a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de gollum de seguirem para Cirith Ungol, uma fissura das montanhas do lado de Minas Morgul, a antiga citadela de gondor e irm\u00e3 g\u00eamea da citadela de Minas Tirith, que agora jaz em sombras depois que os espectros do anel fizeram dali a sua morada. Mas a estrada que devem seguir \u00e9 cheia de perigos e obscura, mas mesmo assim Frodo decide seguir por ali, por ser o \u00fanico caminho que conhece. Assim se despede de Faramir, que os deixa seguir viagem.</p> <p>Os hobbits sobem o vale de morgul em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s escadarias de cirith ungol, passando por l\u00e1 se deparam com o rei dos espectros saindo de sua torre de minas morgul. Depois de passar o terror da sia presen\u00e7a com ajuda do frasco de luz de Galadriel eles avan\u00e7am e sobem pelas escadarias tortuosas que circundam as montanhas de emyn muil. Finalmente chegam exaustos ao t\u00fanel prometido por gollum, mas na sua entrada descobrem uma torre de vigia que promete guardas \u00f3rquicos.</p> <p>Sam e frodo avan\u00e7am pelo tunel escuro quando uma sombra rastejante come\u00e7a a persegui-los. Frodo usa o frasco de luz que recebeu de galadriel e se depara com uma d\u00fazia de olhos a lhe fitarem em horror. Eles conseguem fugir mas ainda sentem a presen\u00e7a maligna os cuidando. Frodo em euforia corre na frente ao se ver livre do terror mas a grande besta aranha chamada Laracna surge entre eles, perseguindo Frodo que agora se v\u00ea desprovido da sua luz \u00e9lfica. Quando sam vai gritar para seu patr\u00e3o tomar cuidado, uma m\u00e3o pegajosa o segura pelo pesco\u00e7o e tapa sua boca, era gollum. Sam luta contra o pegajoso vil\u00e3o e consegue se livrar a partir de uma for\u00e7a s\u00fabita e inesperada.</p> <p>Com f\u00faria e \u00edmpeto Sam avan\u00e7a contra Laracna, golpeando uma de suas patas traseiras que arrastavam Frodo. Ela se vira para o hobbit furioso enquanto ele tenta em v\u00e3o estocar seu saco bulboso de couro revestido por mal\u00edcia. Ela ent\u00e3o se levanta imaculada e desce o corpo para esmagar a criaturinha tola que tenta feri-la. Ela n\u00e3o contava com a espada \u00e9lfica Ferroada na m\u00e3o de Sam, que penetra fundo no seu corpo como ningu\u00e9m jamais tinha conseguido antes. Ela se desespera e tenta fugir por um de seus buracos, se arrastando e deixando uma trilha de sangue verde. Sam ainda alcan\u00e7a mais uma de suas patas para um ultimo golpe de vingan\u00e7a. Depois disso lamenta ao lado de seu patr\u00e3o e chora pela sua morte, decidindo seguir ele mesmo a Demanda e levando consigo o Anel. Mas n\u00e3o muito longe dali ele come\u00e7a a ouvir vozes e algazarra \u00f3rquica, e os orques acabam pegando Frodo e levando para sua torre de vigia. L\u00e1 Sam se v\u00ea necess\u00e1rio a usar o Anel, e percebe que ningu\u00e9m pode v\u00ealo, a n\u00e3o ser o olho que pro ura por ele. Descobre entao que consegue ouvir e entender orques falando e assim ouve que na verdade Frodo nao morreu mas sim foi posto em sono para ser comido com calma pela aranha.</p>"},{"location":"lore/tolkien/lord-of-rings-3/","title":"O Senhor dos An\u00e9is - O Retorno do Rei","text":"<p>Gandalf e Pippin cavalgam em Scadufax rumo a cidade de Minas Tirith, avisando os guardas de Gondor que a tempestade est\u00e1 vindo.

Chegando l\u00e1 salvo por Gandalf, ele conta not\u00edcias sobre Frodo e a guerra no leste. Denethor est\u00e1 amargurado com o filho e manda ele de volta para a guerra, para defender osgiliath. Not\u00edcias chegam de que ele teve que recuar pois o inimigo avan\u00e7o com 10 vezes mais for\u00e7a. </p> <p>Faramir retorna desmaiado e Denethor se desespera. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 mais dia por conta das nuvens negras vindas do leste. Faramir parece a beira da morte e o regente perde toda esperan\u00e7a, deixando nas m\u00e3os de Gandalf o comando da cidade. O regente manda levarem seu filho at\u00e9 as criptas reais e l\u00e1 deita com ele sob um len\u00e7ol branco, mandando seus servos irem buscar chamas para queima-los. Pippin sai em busca de Gandalf pois n\u00e3o acredita que Faramir tenha perecido, e diz para seu amigo guarda Beregond cuidar para o regente n\u00e3o fazer nenhuma loucura.  Enquanto isso o rei dos nazg\u00fbl impulsionava as hostes \u00f3rquicas a partir do medo, e com eles vinha uma gigantesco ar\u00edete com cabe\u00e7a de lobo, era Grond, O Martela da Ru\u00edna. Depois de tr\u00eas golpes aterradores ele consegue partir o port\u00e3o de Gondor, mas l\u00e1 o Feiticeiro senhor dos espectros se depara com Gandalf e Scadufax, inabalaveis. </p> <p>Em algum lugar das florestas ao norte de Gondor, os rohirrim montam acampamento, a um dia de viagem de gondor e da guerra. O rei conversa com o chefe dos homens selvagens que moram ali, e ele os leva por um caminho secreto que permitir\u00e1 os cavaleiros desviarem das defesas feitas pelo inimigo. Assim eles chegam at\u00e9 as muralhas sem serem vistos, pois toda a aten\u00e7\u00e3o dos nazg\u00fbl est\u00e1 na Cidade e no seu port\u00e3o. </p> <p>O rei dos espectros v\u00ea que n\u00e3o vencer\u00e1 batalhando Gandalf, e recua. Os homens de rohan vencem as tropas de Harald, do sul. Mas assim que o estandarte da serpente caiu, uma sombra os abateu, era uma enorme serpe voadora com um cavaleiro negro. O rei conseguiu matar a besta mas foi esmagado pelo seu cavalo em terror. O rei dos espectros diz que nenhum homem vivo pode matalo, mas eis que surge Eowyn, que veio disfar\u00e7ada, e mata ele com ajuda de Merry. </p> <p>Aragorn chega nos barcos dos sulistas e vira a mar\u00e9 da guerra. </p> <p>Pippin vai e encontra Gandalf, juntos v\u00e3o ter com Denethor na cripta dos regentes, e l\u00e1 se deparam com uma cena de horror. O pai sob o filho moribundo, cheio de lenha e madeira empilhada na sua volta, encharcados de \u00f3leo, apenas esperando uma chama. Gandalf de imediato pula e tira Faramir de l\u00e1, e discute com Denethor sobre o que ele est\u00e1 fazendo, descobrindo logo que ele est\u00e1 em m\u00e3os de uma palant\u00edr, e que estava dominado pelas palavras do Inimigo. Ele diz que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 esperan\u00e7a e que n\u00e3o vai deixar Gandalf tomar o poder para s\u00ed, pois sabe que est\u00e1 trazendo algu\u00e9m do sangue de Is\u00edldur para l\u00e1. Visto que n\u00e3o vai conseguir tirar a vida de seu filho moribundo, ele apanha uma tocha e ateia fogo a si mesmo, ainda abra\u00e7ado na esfera negra. </p> <p>\u00c9owyn, Merry e Faramir foram levados para a Casa de Curas. L\u00e1 Aragorn chega para salv\u00e1-los, e assim consegue reviver os tr\u00eas usando a erva-dos-reis, athelas. Faramir o reconhece como rei, \u00c9owyn n\u00e3o o v\u00ea mas conversa com seu irm\u00e3o \u00c9omer, e Merry acorda com pesar mas sem trevas no cora\u00e7\u00e3o, e j\u00e1 est\u00e1 bem acompanhado de Pippin com jantar e cachimbo. O rumor de que o Rei est\u00e1 na cidade se espalha e logo Aragorn e os irm\u00e3os filhos de Elrond saem curando os enfermos. Ele por fim vai descansar no seu acampamento em frente \u00e0 cidade e some. </p> <p>Legolas e Gimli sobem a cidade para ver os hobbits, e passam pelo pr\u00edncipe Imrahil. Legolas conta que Aragorn chamou ele e \u00c9omer para sua tenda afim de discutir os pr\u00f3ximos passos, e que gandalf j\u00e1 estava l\u00e1. </p> <p>Enquanto isso os dois amigos se reencontraram com os hobbits e conversaram sobre como sairam da Senda dos Mortos e foram avan\u00e7ando pelo sul tocando o terror pelos fantasmas atr\u00e1s de si. Eles contam que chegaram at\u00e9 a frota de Ulmar e Harald e l\u00e1 seus inimigos foram recha\u00e7ados pelo medo e horror dos mortos que choveram sob eles. Assim Aragorn liberou os amaldi\u00e7oados do seu fardo e foram livres para Gondor pelas naus dos inimigos. </p> <p>Gandalf reunido com os senhores dos homens conta como Denethor viu o poder de Mordor na palantir e que a esperan\u00e7a de vit\u00f3ria era nula, mas que o portador do anel precisava passar despercebido, e por isso as for\u00e7as deveriam ir para Mordor como isca, tirando aten\u00e7\u00e3o do olho de sua pr\u00f3pria terra. </p> <p>O ex\u00e9rcito parte para os port\u00f5es de Mordor e retomam a encruzilhada do rei ca\u00eddo. Quando chegam na frente dos port\u00f5es, um mensageiro cavalga at\u00e9 eles em um grande cavalo negro e esquel\u00e9tico, era Boca de Sauron, um N\u00famenoreano Negro que virou o primeiro comandante da torre negra de barad-dur. Ele regateia com gandalf e mostra a espada elfica de sam, a cota de mithril de frodo e a capa elfica deles, dizendo que deveriam aceitar a rendi\u00e7\u00e3o. Gandalf n\u00e3o aceita e assim come\u00e7a a guerra com um subito ataque de mordor. Pippin salva Beregond de um ataque de trols das colinas e desmaia ouvindo gritarem que as \u00c1guias chegaram. </p> <p>Sam decide entrar pela porta da frente da torre de Cirith Ungol. Antes ele avista a montanha de fogo e a terra desolada de Mordor. L\u00e1 dentro ele encontra um banho de sangue e muitos orcs mortos no ch\u00e3o, e conclui que deve ser uma briga entre os dois capit\u00e3es Gorbag e ??? Ele ent\u00e3o segue perseguindo um orc que o viu e saiu correndo para cima. </p> <p>Um dos capit\u00e3es carregava uma trouxa com as coisas de Frodo, e Sam teve que deixa-lo ir para focar no resgate do seu patr\u00e3o. Ele chega no segundo andar da torre e n\u00e3o consegue avan\u00e7ar. Desesperado ele come\u00e7a a cantar ao se lembrar do Condado e de Bilbo. Como resposta uma voz de orque o manda se calar, e ele descobre que h\u00e1 um al\u00e7ap\u00e3o acess\u00edvel apenas por uma escada presa em cima. Ele ouve o orque falando para algu\u00e9m ficar quieto e amea\u00e7a com um chicote. Sam se enfurece e avan\u00e7a para cima do orque, cortando fora sua m\u00e3o e o fazendo cair pela escada. L\u00e1 encontra Frodo n\u00fa e curvado com marcas de chicote. Ele ent\u00e3o resgata seu patr\u00e3o e veste ambos com roupas \u00e9lficas. Conseguem escapar e destroem as sentinelas, mas n\u00e3o antes delas soltarem seu alerta e um nazgul vir voando para l\u00e1. Conseguem escapar e sobem para o norte dentro da terra de mordor. </p> <p>Vestidos como orques eles avan\u00e7am para o norte at\u00e9 chegarem perto da boca serrada de Ud\u00fbm. L\u00e1 eles se deparam com uma tropa de orques em marcha e s\u00e3o obrigados a segui-los. Mais para frente quando est\u00e3o quase desmaiando de cansa\u00e7o uma encruzilhada junta diversas tropas e com isso brota uma briga. Eles aproveitam para escapulir dali. </p> <p>Se aproximam do monte da perdi\u00e7\u00e3o exaustos e se arrastando. Frodo est\u00e1 no seu limite e Sam descobre uma for\u00e7a excepcional para seguir em frente. </p> <p>L\u00e1 eles descobrem uma trilha que sobe at\u00e9 o cume, decidem descansar quando sentem um subito surto de pressa e ansiedade, como se uma voz dissesse que deveriam ir agora, pois n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito mais tempo. </p> <p>Eles chegam at\u00e9 a beirada dos fogos do vulc\u00e3o, mas frodo sucumbe ao Anel e diz que n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 deixa-lo, colocando-o no dedo. Gollum aparece e se engalfinha com o hobbit. Por fim ele morde o dedo do anel fora, fica emocionado e acaba caindo no vulc\u00e3o. Junto disso as \u00e1guias chegam nos campos de batalha e gandalf monta gwaihir em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a frodo e sam. </p> <p>Antes de serem tocados pela lava e depois de cairem de exaust\u00e3o as \u00e1guias e gandalf salvam os hobbits. Eles acordam em Ithilien e s\u00e3o louvados com as maiores honras. </p> <p>Depois volta para Gondor e conta sobre como \u00c9owyn e Faramir se recuperando nas casas de cura. Aragorn \u00e9 conclamado rei e Faramir vira principe de Ithilien com Eowyn, mas ela diz que deve primeiro voltar at\u00e9 a marca com seu irm\u00e3o o rei \u00e9omer. Os hobbits ficam com gandalf, o elfo e o an\u00e3o enquanto a cidade de gondor \u00e9 reconstruida, mas frodo cresce impaciente e deseja voltar para o condado e para bilbo. </p> <p>Aragorn vai com Gandalf em cima das montanhas atr\u00e1s de Minas tirith e l\u00e1 encontra um broto da \u00e1rvore sagrada de gondor. Ele a planta e se prepara para receber a comitiva do oeste. Elrond, Galadriel e Celeborn, \u00c9omer e \u00c9owyn, e Arwen viajam at\u00e9 Minas Tirith, e l\u00e1 Aragorn desposa Arwen como sua rainha. Depois de alguns dias decidem partir para o funeral de Th\u00e9oden, e depois disso sobem para Isengard. L\u00e1 encontram Orthanc cercada por um jardim, e Barb\u00e1rvore os recebe com novas de Saruman, o qual foi libertado pelo Ent. Subindo mais eles se despedem do povo de L\u00f3rien e de Legolas e Gimli, que v\u00e3o para Fangorn. Assim eles passam para Valfenda e se encontram com Bilbo, que agora est\u00e1 mais velho e sonolento. Depois se dirigem com Gandalf para Bri, e l\u00e1 ficam sabendo que o p\u00f4nei de Sam, o Bill, estava vivo e se recuperando depois de voltar sozinho. Mas as coisas estavam sinistras em Bri, poucos clientes no P\u00f4nei Empinado, e muitos ataques de rufi\u00f5es e bandidos. Carrapicho diz que at\u00e9 o Condado parece mudado e menos amig\u00e1vel. Os quatro companheiros se dirigem de volta para sua terra e se despedem de Gandalf, que diz que seu tempo na terra media est\u00e1 chegando ao fim junto com o fim da terceira era. E com isso ele diz que precisa ir ter com Tom Bombadil. </p> <p>chegaram no condado e viram que rufi\u00f5es do sul tomaram conta. Eram meio homens e meio orques. Reuniram os hobbits e lutaram contra eles. Merry e pippin lideraram os hobbits e assim os venceram com duas dezenas de baixas entre eles. </p> <p>Saruman estava por tras de tudo no condado e fugiu tentando esfaquear frodo. Grima foi chamado para ficar no condado mas saruman o esculachou e chutou sua cara, ele tirou uma adaga e cortou a garganta do velho mestre. Depois disso houve tempos de reconstrucao no condado e sam semeou todas arvores derrubadas pelo Charcoso saruman. Uma Mallorn cresceu da semente dada a ele por Galadriel. Ele depois se casa com Rosinha Villa e os dois tem sua primeira filha, Elanor. Frodo se despede de todos e vai para o oeste com bilbo e os tres senhores elfos, elrond galadriel e gandalf. </p>"},{"location":"lore/tolkien/o-hobbit/","title":"O Hobbit","text":"<p>Bilbo \u00e9 um hobbit, um ser pequenino, barrigudo e de p\u00e9s descal\u00e7o que adora ch\u00e1, cachimbos e comida. Ele mora numa toca luxuosa na encosta d'A Colina, com uma porta redonda e verde com uma ma\u00e7aneta bem no centro. Um belo dia ele estava baforando seu cachimbo depois do desjejum quando Gandalf aparece. Ele \u00e9 um sujeito alto, de chap\u00e9u pontudo e robes longos, ambos cinzentos, com uma barba branca. O hobbit diz um espirituoso \"bom dia\", e \u00e9 indagado por Gandalf sobre qual o sentido daquelas palavras. Ele se surpreende pelo filho de Beladona T\u00fbk n\u00e3o se lembrar dele, e depois diz que o perdoa e que vai inclu\u00ed-lo em uma aventura. Bilbo diz que n\u00e3o tem interesse e diz para ele aparecer qualquer outro dia para o ch\u00e1, quarta-feira talvez. Mas fica t\u00e3o agitado que nem se lembra do compromisso, e, ao chegar a data, se depara com um an\u00e3o de barba azul e capa verde cinzenta, era Dwalin.</p> <p>Em seguida, diversos an\u00e3os chegam \u00e0 sua porta. Bilbo os recebe como um bom anfitri\u00e3o. Por fim, Gandalf chega e apaga a runa que pintou na sua porta. Eles jantam e cantam sobre sua sina. Eles n\u00e3o est\u00e3o confiantes com o Hobbit, e isso faz ferver o sangue T\u00fbk dentro dele. Gandalf o apoia dizendo que ele \u00e9 o gatuno escolhido para essa miss\u00e3o.</p> <p>Gandalf d\u00e1 a Thorin o mapa de Thror e a chave lateral da montanha. Eles ent\u00e3o contam a hist\u00f3ria sobre como o drag\u00e3o Smaug assolou a cidade de Valle, e de como ele tomou para si todo o tesouro da montanha dos an\u00e3os. A ideia \u00e9 levar Bilbo como um gatuno capaz de se esgueirar pela porta.</p> <p>Bilbo acorda no outro dia feliz de que os an\u00e3os se foram, e desfruta de um bom desjejum quando Gandalf aparece na sua porta. Ele diz que Bilbo est\u00e1 atrasado e que Thorin escreveu uma carta a ele, dizendo para ir at\u00e9 a estalagem Drag\u00e3o Verde, no Beir\u00e1gua. De l\u00e1 come\u00e7aram sua aventura, viajando em P\u00f4neis, cantando e se dirigindo sempre para o leste. Uma forte chuva fez com que todos focassem molhados e com frio, sem esperan\u00e7a de acenderem uma fogueira. Um dos p\u00f4neis fugiu assustado e se perdeu no rio, com um carregamento de comida. Ent\u00e3o Balin, o vigia do grupo, v\u00ea uma luz avermelhada no horizonte. Decidem ent\u00e3o mandar Bilbo verificar o que \u00e9, e ele se depara com tr\u00eas Trols discutindo sobre sua fogueira.</p> <p>Bilbo tenta roubar a carteira de um dos trols enquanto eles discutem, mas ela \u00e9 do diabo e falava. O trol o captura e o interroga sobre seus companheiros, assim um por um atacam os brutamontes e s\u00e3o capturados em sacos de linho. Thorin chega por \u00faltimo e consegue cegar um dos trols, acertando a boca de outro, mesmo assim \u00e9 capturado. Enquanto os trols discutem sobre como cozinhar os an\u00e3os, Gandalf surge e confunde os trols para causar brigas e atrasar eles at\u00e9 que sol nasce, e eles viram pedra.</p> <p>A comitiva se depara com as montanhas nevoentas, onde um vale corre longo e sonolento nas noites de ver\u00e3o. Uma m\u00fasica \u00e9 cantada por vozes alegres que se escondem no meio das \u00e1rvores, s\u00e3o os elfos de Valfenda. L\u00e1 o amigo-dos-elfos Elrond vive, um importante filho de elfos e homens que est\u00e1 presente em diversas hist\u00f3rias, tanto passadas como futuras. Na sua casa, os an\u00e3os, o hobbit e o mago descansaram, se recuperaram e receberam bons conselhos. Elrond reconheceu as espadas recuperadas dos trols por Gandalf e Thorin. A de Thorin era Orcrist, a Corta-gobelim, e a de Gandalf era Glamdring, Martelo-do-inimigo, que o rei de Gondolin certa vez usou.</p> <p>Bilbo, Gandalf e os an\u00e3os sa\u00edram empolgados de Valfenda, confiantes de que tudo daria certo. Mas ap\u00f3s dias subindo as montanhas nevoentas, eles foram ficando cada vez mais agourentos com o seu destino. Chuva incessante, luta de tempestade de raios e gigantes de pedra fazendo festa os levaram at\u00e9 uma caverna na montanha. Estavam finalmente secos e descansando quando uma ranhura na parede da caverna se abre e gobelins come\u00e7am a jorrar de l\u00e1. Os an\u00e3os e o hobbit s\u00e3o capturados, menos Gandalf que conseguiu se safar jorrando um leque de raios que deixou v\u00e1rios deles tostados. Ao serem levados at\u00e9 o grande chefe gobelim, um ser gordo e enorme que quis saber quem eram e o que queriam. Eles tentam se safar, mas ao vislumbre da espada \u00e9lfica de Thorin todos entram em frenesi, pois odiavam a Orcrist, a matadora de gobelins. Eles conseguem fugir com a interven\u00e7\u00e3o de Gandalf, que apaga todas as luzes e usa a fogueira central para atacar com chamas vermelhas provenientes da sua espada Glamdring, o martelo-do-inimigo. Conseguem escapar, mas com os gobelins no seu encal\u00e7o, que sorrateiramente atacam Dori, que estava na retaguarda carregando Bilbo. Eles caem, o hobbit desmaia e n\u00e3o v\u00ea mais nada.</p> <p>Bilbo acorda no breu total da caverna, e percebe a sua adaga brilhando na escurid\u00e3o. Ele ent\u00e3o decide seguir em frente at\u00e9 se deparar com um lago sombrio. Nesse lago vive Gollum, uma criatura magricela e curvada que perdeu o contato com o mundo exterior h\u00e1 muitas eras atr\u00e1s. Ele se aproxima do hobbit por curiosidade no seu barquinho, e o convida a jogar adivinhas em troca de mostrar o caminho da sa\u00edda. Os dois se mostram \u00f3timos nesse jogo e isso faz a criatura se irritar. Bilbo ent\u00e3o se desespera e fala mais para si do que para os outros: \"O que tenho nos bolsos?\". Ele tinha achado um anel no ch\u00e3o da caverna, colocando no bolso e o esquecendo logo em seguida. Agora ele usa a pergunta como charada e Gollum n\u00e3o consegue responder. Gollum ent\u00e3o diz que precisa pegar algumas coisas antes de guiar o Hobbit para a sa\u00edda, e com isso ele queria uma chance para pegar seu \"presente de anivers\u00e1rio\", o anel m\u00e1gico que Bilbo encontrou por acaso. Ao colocar o anel, Bilbo se torna invis\u00edvel, e assim segue Gollum pelo caminho at\u00e9 a porta dos fundos da caverna. L\u00e1 ele consegue passar pelo Gollum pulando por cima dele, e em seguida escapa dos gobelins se esgueirando pela porta, mas n\u00e3o antes de deixar alguns bot\u00f5es do seu gib\u00e3o ao tentar atravess\u00e1-la.</p> <p>Bilbo reencontra sua comitiva do lado fora da caverna. Todos est\u00e3o felizes de v\u00ea-lo e agora passam a respeit\u00e1-lo como um gatuno habilidoso. Agora seguem descendo a encosta da montanha, aproveitando os \u00faltimos raios de sol para criarem dist\u00e2ncia dos gobelins.</p> <p>A comitiva desce das montanhas nevoentas por uma encosta \u00edngreme e est\u00e9ril, por sorte n\u00e3o s\u00e3o esmagados pelas avalanches. Chegam a uma floresta densa e caminham at\u00e9 o crep\u00fasculo, quando se deparam com uma clareira iluminada pela lua. Ao se aproximarem come\u00e7am a ouvir uivos sinistros, e logo percebem que o som est\u00e1 chegando mais perto e os cercando. Decidem ent\u00e3o subir nas \u00e1rvores para se protegerem, e logo em seguida centenas de Wargs aparecem, os grandes lobos malignos Eles cercam e come\u00e7am a conversar com o seu l\u00edder, um grande lobo cinzento. Gandalf entende sua l\u00edngua e ouve como hoje estava marcado com os gobelins um assalto contra os homens e suas fazendas do sul. Gandalf ent\u00e3o come\u00e7a a jogar pinhas flamejantes nos lobos, at\u00e9 que os gobelins chegam e ateiam fogo nas \u00e1rvores que eles estavam apinhados. S\u00e3o salvos de \u00faltima hora pelo grande Lorde das \u00c1guias.</p> <p>As \u00e1guias os deixam mais ao leste, em uma grande eleva\u00e7\u00e3o no meio do rio, a Carrocha. L\u00e1 fizeram seus planos e Gandalf os alertou de que em breve se despediria do grupo, pois seu trabalho de lev\u00e1-los pelas montanhas nevoentas tinha sido feito. Em seguida diz que h\u00e1 um lugar onde podem conseguir abrigo e suprimentos, e os leva at\u00e9 l\u00e1. Um homem grande e forte chamado Beorn mora nas bordas de Trevamata, e ele \u00e9 um troca-peles. Um druida que pode se transformar em animais e que conversa com eles, vivendo em harmonia com a natureza. Ouviu a hist\u00f3ria da jornada dos an\u00e3os e forneceu a eles montarias, comida e orienta\u00e7\u00f5es para a travessia por Trevamata que est\u00e1 por come\u00e7ar.</p> <p>A comitiva avan\u00e7a na floresta e se depara com um rio encantado. Eles atravessam a partir de um barquinho que estava do outro lado da margem. Por\u00e9m, chegando do outro lado, um grande cervo avan\u00e7a sobre eles e Bombur cai na \u00e1gua, sendo resgatado, por\u00e9m, caindo em um sono profundo, com sonhos de vastos sal\u00f5es e festas na floresta \u00e0 luz de tochas. Depois disso avan\u00e7am na trilha at\u00e9 n\u00e3o aguentarem mais, e mandam o hobbit subir uma \u00e1rvore e espiar pelo fim da floresta. Ele n\u00e3o v\u00ea nada al\u00e9m de um mar verde e de grandes borboletas negras. Depois disso come\u00e7am a surgir clareiras com luz e sons de m\u00fasica. Elfos-da-floresta est\u00e3o festejando, por\u00e9m, somem imediatamente quando os an\u00e3os adentram seu per\u00edmetro. Isso acontece mais duas vezes, at\u00e9 que bilbo \u00e9 empurrado para frente e cai em sono. Quando desperta se depara sozinho e no escuro total. Ele v\u00ea ent\u00e3o uma regi\u00e3o mais escura que o breu e identifica com horror que os an\u00e3os foram capturados e pendurados nas \u00e1rvores por terr\u00edveis aranhas. Elas est\u00e3o conversando sobre como comer seus companheiros quando Bilbo toma coragem e come\u00e7a a atirar pedras contra elas. Em seguida atrai todas para longe, cantando tro\u00e7as e fugindo usando seu anel m\u00e1gico. Ele assim resgata os an\u00e3os e os ajuda a escapar, chamando as aranhas para longe e matando v\u00e1rias delas com sua adaga \u00e9lfica, que a apelida de \"Ferroada\". Enquanto isso, Thorin se depara cativo dos elfos, que querem saber o que ele faz l\u00e1 e onde est\u00e1 o seu tesouro, algo de suma import\u00e2ncia para o rei \u00e9lfico.</p> <p>Os an\u00e3os discutiam o que fazer quando foram capturados pelos elfos da floresta. O rei queria saber o que queriam ali e ao n\u00e3o receber resposta trancou eles, todos menos bilbo, que escapuliu usando seu anel m\u00e1gico. Ele vagou por semanas e aprendeu o local de cada um dos an\u00e3os, bolando enfim um plano desesperado de escapar de l\u00e1. Havia um al\u00e7ap\u00e3o de carvalho que se abria para os barris da adega do rei serem transportados rio abaixo. Em um evento especial que deixou todos os elfos em festa, Bilbo colocou cada um dos an\u00e3os em barril, sendo ele mesmo transportado se agarrando ao topo de um deles. Assim conseguiram escapar despercebidos da grande caverna fortaleza do rei \u00e9lfico.</p> <p>Bilbo e os an\u00e3os descem o rio da floresta em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao Lago Longo, e a cidade dos homens que viviam ali. A Cidade-do-lago, como era chamada, vivia do com\u00e9rcio com os elfos das balsas e dos outros povos de homens do sul. Thorin chegou \u00e0 cidade anunciando-se o neto do Rei sob a Montanha, e foi recebido como tal. Ap\u00f3s semanas se recuperando, decidem enfim partir rumo ao norte, para a Montanha Solit\u00e1ria.</p> <p>Ap\u00f3s semanas vagando no sop\u00e9 sul da montanha solit\u00e1ria, Bilbo, Fili e Kili descobrem uma escadaria que dava para a soleira da porta secreta. Passaram dias rondando a porta em busca de uma forma de abri-la, at\u00e9 que bilbo descobre o segredo a partir das atitudes de um torvo negro que comia um caracol em uma abertura da porta. Ela precisava dos raios do sol poente do \u00faltimo dia do outono, e assim uma pequena abertura surgiu, onde Thorin enfiou a chave que havia recebido com o mapa de seu av\u00f4. Assim os an\u00e3os conseguiram abrir a pequena porta secreta, e Bilbo adentrou para seu \u00faltimo trabalho e maior desafio at\u00e9 agora.</p> <p>Bilbo adentra o vasto sal\u00e3o principal da montanha, e se depara com uma imensid\u00e3o indescrit\u00edvel de tesouros. Ouro, prata e toda sorte de gemas preciosas, um verdadeiro mar de tesouros, onde uma grande serpe jaz dormindo. Era Smaug, o tem\u00edvel drag\u00e3o. Bilbo ent\u00e3o escolhe uma jarra do meio do tesouro e a leva at\u00e9 os an\u00e3os. Por\u00e9m, a felicidade deles dura pouco, pois Smaug acorda e da falta da jarra imediatamente, visto que sabe de cor cada pe\u00e7a do seu precioso montante. Ele ent\u00e3o sai da montanha como um terremoto e vulc\u00e3o em erup\u00e7\u00e3o, e demora todo o fim do dia at\u00e9 que se cansa e decide voltar. Bilbo ent\u00e3o \u00e9 mandado de novo para as profundezas para assim tentar descobrir alguma fraqueza do poderoso Smaug, e se depara com o drag\u00e3o semi acordado e esperando por ele. Mesmo sem poder v\u00ea-lo nem ouvi-lo (devido ao anel e dos sorrateiros p\u00e9s de Hobbit), ele ainda assim pode farej\u00e1-lo, e assim o interlope sobre o que ele quer ali. Ap\u00f3s trocar charadas com o drag\u00e3o, bilbo descobre uma fraqueza na grande barriga da serpente, e decide voltar para dizer isso aos seus companheiros. Faz isso, por\u00e9m, uma tro\u00e7a de despedida que enfurece a serpe, e ele sai em disparada para destruir a Cidade-do-Lago, de onde tem certeza que Bilbo, o \"Cavaleiro-do-barril\" veio ou teve ajuda. Isso o deixa profundamente triste, e ao se deparar com o mesmo tordo na sua pedra, se enfurece e joga uma pedra contra a ave, que desvia e continua tranquila onde estava. Thorin o adverte e diz que essa \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie rara de tordo, que vivia na \u00e9poca de seu av\u00f4 e que dizem era capaz de conversar com o povo de l\u00e1, enviando mensagens de um reino para o outro. E assim o tordo fica at\u00e9 que os an\u00e3os terminem de confabular sobre como podem chegar perto da fraqueza de Smaug, um peda\u00e7o da carapa\u00e7a do peito esquerdo que est\u00e1 desprotegido. Ap\u00f3s ouvir isso, a ave al\u00e7a voo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao sul. Bilbo est\u00e1 nervoso com o sil\u00eancio de Smaug, e pede para entrarem no t\u00fanel para se protegerem, pois acredita que inevitavelmente o drag\u00e3o h\u00e1 de encontrar o seu acampamento na soleira da porta secreta. Eles entram bem a tempo de tudo atr\u00e1s de si desabar pela f\u00faria do drag\u00e3o.</p> <p>Bilbo e os an\u00e3os exploram o sal\u00e3o do tesouro, aproveitando o sumi\u00e7o do drag\u00e3o. Bilbo foi na frente e se deparou com Ankhen, a pedra da luz que \u00e9 chamada de Cora\u00e7\u00e3o da Montanha, o tesouro mais valioso de Thror. Thorin a procura incessantemente mas n\u00e3o sabe que Bilbo a pegou. Eles ent\u00e3o se vestem com as armaduras e armas do sal\u00e3o, e bilbo \u00e9 agraciado com uma cota de malha feita de mithril. Eles ent\u00e3o sobem para o port\u00e3o principal da montanha e saem em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao Montecorvo onde pensam como podem resolver a quest\u00e3o da grande serpe que os atormenta.</p> <p>Smaug voa em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Esgaroth, a cidade do lago. L\u00e1 os homens preparam uma defensiva, por\u00e9m com pouca esperan\u00e7a. Mulheres e crian\u00e7as j\u00e1 se dirigiam aos barcos para fugirem, junto com o covarde Mestre da cidade, quando o lider da guarda Bard, monta sua \u00faltima defesa. Ele \u00e9 descendente de Girion, rei de Valle, e por conta disso consegue entender a fala do tordo que pousa no seu ombro. A ave ent\u00e3o diz da fraqueza de Smaug, e pede para Bard guardar sua \u00faltima flecha para quando a luz da lua iluminar a carapa\u00e7a inferior do drag\u00e3o. Assim Bard, com seu grande arco de freixo, lan\u00e7a a flecha de metal escuro proveniente dos tempos de Valle e que nunca falhou com ele, sendo sempre recuperada. A flecha percorre reta e trespassa o drag\u00e3o, sumindo cabo e pena para dentro da serpe. Ele assim cai no fundo do lago, levando consigo Esgaroth junto. O velho tordo retorna aos an\u00e3os e parece \u00e1vido para dizer algo. Nenhum deles o entende, e Balin diz que desejava que fossem corvos, pois eles eram grande amigos dos an\u00e3os e conversavam com eles. Um velho amigo deles era Cram e sua esposa, que viviam em cima da casa de vigia de Montecorvo. Ao ouvir isso o velho tordo foi-se embora e voltou em seguida acompanhando de um corvo anci\u00e3o, que dizia filho de Cram e que conseguia conversar com todos eles, pois usava a l\u00edngua comum. Ele disse as noticias da morte do drag\u00e3o, e que tanto homens como elfos estavam se movendo para a Montanha em busca dos tesouros que imaginavam estar desgarrados. Assim Thorin se enfurece devido \u00e0 gan\u00e2ncia do tesouro do drag\u00e3o, e pede para os corvos enviarem pedidos de ajuda at\u00e9 as colinas de ferro onde seu primo Dain vivia. Depois disso os an\u00e3os se preparam para barricar o port\u00e3o principal da montanha, e Thorin rejeita qualquer tipo de negocia\u00e7\u00e3o com Bard, o descendente dos homens de Valle que matou Smaug com uma flechada bem em seu ponto fraco, que ele ficou sabendo pela dica do velho tordo que voou at\u00e9 ele.</p> <p>Bilbo est\u00e1 farto da montanha, e come\u00e7a a elaborar um plano quando ouve as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es de Thorin a respeito da pedra Arken, que ele n\u00e3o consegue encontrar e jurar destruir qualquer um que esteja em posse dela. Assim ele escolhe uma noite sem lua e sai em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao acampamento dos elfos. L\u00e1 ele fala com Bard e o rei-elfo, e diz que Dain est\u00e1 vindo, e que a pedra Arken pode ser um bom contrapeso nas barganhas com Thorin. Ele a deixa l\u00e1 e retorna para seus amigos, n\u00e3o antes de falar com Gandalf, que est\u00e1 muito impressionado com o Sr. Bolseiro.</p> <p>Thorin se enfurece com o hobbit e n\u00e3o quer saber de negocia\u00e7\u00e3o, confiante de que o exercito de seu primo seja suficiente para sobrepujar as for\u00e7as que o cercam. Assim a guerra est\u00e1 prestes a explodir entre an\u00e3os, elfos e homens quando do norte vem uma tempestade negra. Entre ambos ex\u00e9rcitos Gandalf aparece e pede para que parem com aquilo, dizendo que os gobelins de Bolg, filho de Azog, estava vindo atac\u00e1-los. A luta ent\u00e3o come\u00e7a, conhecida como A Guerra dos Cinco Ex\u00e9rcitos, onde os gobelins quase conseguem derrotar os homens, an\u00e3os e elfos ali reunidos, se n\u00e3o fossem as \u00c1guias que chegam para ajuda-los.</p> <p>Bilbo volta pra casa com gandalf e v\u00ea que est\u00e3o leiloando suas coisas por pensarem que est\u00e1 morto. Gandalf conta a Elrond sobre a reuni\u00e3o de magos brancos e como eles livraram Trevamata do dom\u00ednio do Necromante. Assim o livro acaba, com Bilbo em sua toca de Hobbit, recebendo Gandalf e Balin para um ch\u00e1.</p>"},{"location":"lore/tolkien/silmarillion/","title":"O Silmarillion","text":"<p>No inicio tem introducoes do tradutor e de cristopher tolkien.

Eles ent\u00e3o cantam, cada um com uma parte de Eru e aprendendo com a M\u00fasica dos outros. Aqui a m\u00fasica representa a magia, e grandes feitos foram realizados a partir dessa sinfonia primordial. Dentre eles o mais poderoso era Melkor, e ele se sentiu tentado a criar coisas s\u00f3 suas, e assim adquirir mais poder e dom\u00ednio. Mas isso enfureceu Il\u00favatar, que fez o sil\u00eancio cair sobre eles. E depois mostrou o resultado das suas M\u00fasicas. Arda, a Terra, que no seu estado primordial tinha as \u00e1guas de Ulmo, os ventos de Manwe, as rochas de Aule e os fogos de Melkor. Assim eles viram o que era esperado deles, e sentiram amor pela terra e os seres que l\u00e1 iriam morar. Os filhos de Il\u00favatar estavam tendo sua morada preparada pelos Valar e suas musicas.

Depois Aule e Yavanna seguiam como mestres da terra, do engenho e das coisas vivas, pois Yavanna era a respons\u00e1vel pela natureza. Ainda tinha os g\u00eameos Mandos e L\u00f3rien, o primeiro cuidava dos mortos e o segundo dos sonhos. Mandos era companheiro de Maire, a Tecel\u00e2, que tece o destino do mundo em grandes tapecarias, expostas nos sal\u00f5es de Mandos.

Mas n\u00e3o percebem Melkor que se infriltou pelo norte, camuflado pelas luzes dos grandes lampi\u00f5es presente no norte e sul de Ea. Ent\u00e3o Melkor invade e destroi os pilares com os lampioes, revoltando a terra e os mares. Os valar decidem ent\u00e3o fazer Valinor, no extremo oeste. L\u00e1 eles vivem em paz.</p> <p>No inicio os poderes que cuidavam da terra era manwe nos ares, ulmo nos mares, aule na terra, yavanna na natureza e orome nas ca\u00e7adas contra os servos de melkor, que se escondia na escuridao e saia de sua toca para causar terror.</p> <p>Aule n\u00e3o aguentou a espera pelos primog\u00eanitos, pois estava impaciente por algu\u00e9m para amar e ensinar seu oficio. Por isso fez em segredo os an\u00f5es, e os amou e ensinou como trabalhar a pedra. Mas il\u00favatar o questionou e ele se arrependeu, e estava prestes a destrui-los quando a sua humildade apaziguou Eru, e ele deixou que os seus filhos vivessem, mas nao antes dos primogenitos, e por isso dormiram. Esses primeiros anaos eram os 8 pais dos an\u00e3os, dentre eles Durin era o mais renomado por ser amigo dos elfos. Mas Yavanna se preocupou por Aule ter criado em segredo dela, e por isso preocupou-se com as suas obras, e foi ter com Manwe, que disse que sim, todas as criaturas haveriam de usar suas arvores e seus rebentos. Mas ele viu na can\u00e7\u00e3o de iluvatar que dentre as \u00e1rvores haveriam de morar esp\u00edritos e guardi\u00f5es das \u00e1rvores, e Yavanna contou como ao fazer chuva algumas \u00e1rvores cantavam poesia pr\u00f3pria louvando iluvatar, e assim Manwe prometeu que dentre as arvores haveria de ter os pastores-de-arvores para protege-las.</p> <p>Com a chegada dos elfos se aproximando os Valar se preocuparam com o estado em que a terra media se encontrava, por isso decidiram se levantar novamente contra Melkor, e o aprisionaram por tr\u00eas eras, mas de Sauron n\u00e3o tiveram noticias.</p> <p>Com as estrelas no ceu os elfos vieram, e l\u00e1 desenvolveram sua fala e se consideraram os Eldar. Orome foi o primeiro a ter com eles e indicou tr\u00eas emissarios para irem em Valinor conhecer os poderes e assim convencer seu povo para se juntarem a eles. Esses tr\u00eas eram Finwe, ingwe e Elwe, que se tornaram rei dentre os Eldar.</p> <p>Primeiro foi a hoste de Ingwe, e foram reverenciados por Manwe e Varda e nunca mais voltaram para a terra-media, e eram chamados de Vanyar, os belos elfos. Depois foi a hoste de Finwe, conhecidos como os Noldor, os elfos profundos, e reverentes a Aule, um povo de grande engenho e renomados art\u00edfices. Por fim foi o povo de Elwe, se demorando na estrada e enamorados pelo mar, ficaram nas costas de Aman e foram conhecidos como Teleri, os elfos do mar. Aqueles que n\u00e3o quiseram ir ou se perderam no caminho ficaram conhecidos como Elfos da Escurid\u00e3o, os Moriquendi.</p> <p>Elwe estava avido para encontrar os Noldor, pois era muito amigo de Finwe, e vagando por Beleriand ele foi hipnotizado pelo cantos dos rouxinois, pois cantavam a m\u00fasica que Melian os ensinou. Melian era uma Maia do povo dos Valar, e tinha o canto mais bonito de todos, sendo ela mesma aparentada com Yavanna. Elwe se encontra com ela e toca sua m\u00e3o, sendo os dois paralizados por muito tempo, onde altas arvores crescem a seu redor. Assim Elwe vira Thingol, e mora com Melian na floresta de Doriath.</p> <p>Finwe tem seu primogenito curufinwe, Feanor como foi chamado pela sua mae. Alem dele o rei tambem teve fingolfin e finarfin, mas com m\u00e3e diferente, pois a mae de feanor morreu logo depois de ter lhe dado a luz, dizendo que botou toda a sua energia em seu filho. E feanor foi o maior de todos os noldor no conhecimento, e aprendeu muito com o pai de sua mulher, um ferreiro que tinha aprendido com o prioprio Aule. E assim foi que maravilhado com a luz das duas arvores, feanor fez as silmarils, pedras que de alguma forma conseguiram capturar a luz delas e mesclar em uma gema das mais preciosas ja criadas.</p> <p>As arvores representavam a luz em Valinor e vieram dos frutos de Yavanna, uma delas era clara e dourada com flores, representando o calor chamada Laurelin, e a outra era prateada e fria, refrescante e com orvalhos sempre a pingar, e se chamava Telperion, e ambas se completavam.</p> <p>Todos se maravilharam com a criacao de feanor e a ele foi dado muitas honras. Mas Melkor, que agora caminhava entre os Eldar e aparentava ser um bom conselheiro e ajudante, odiou e invejou feanor e as silmarils mais do que tudo. E assim comecou a semear a inveja e a desconfianca no coracao dos noldor, que foram se tornando soberbos com o tempo.</p> <p>Assim feanor foi enganado por melkor que plantou em sua mente a desconfian\u00e7a de seu proprio irmao, e pelo desejo possessivo com as gemas ele levantou armas contra ele, e foi trazido diante dos Valar para explicar-se. Assim melkor foi desvelado e fugiu de Valinor. E Feanor tambem teve que ser exilado pelo crime que cometeu, de levantar armas e de levantar seu povo contra os deuses.</p> <p>Melkor fugiu para o sul, escapando dos Valar que o procuravam no norte. L\u00e1 ele se encontra com Ungoliant, um ser mais antigo que o tempo que veio do Vazio at\u00e9 a Terra. Foi corrompido por Melkor mas se livrou do seu dominio e respondia apenas a sua propria gula. E no sul de Aman ela tomou a forma de uma gigantesca aranha, e nas sombras esquecidas ela consumia tudo o que estava ao seu alcance, inclusive a luz. E transforma do a luz em escuridao tecia teias de antiluz.</p> <p>Melkor a convenceu a ajuda-lo e em troca poderia consumir o que quisesse, caso no fim ainda tivesse fome. Assim ela fez para eles uma nuvem de Desluz capaz de tornar invisivel aquilo que tocasse. E assim Melkor aproveitou um grande banquete em homenagem a colheita para se esgueirar ate as arvores e ataca las com sua lan\u00e7a negra. E a seiva delas jorrou como sangue, e ungoliant a tomou ate estarem secas e mortas. Enquanto isso todos os eldar estavam reunidos em valinor, e feanor foi perdoado pelo seu irmao. e Varda viu ao longe o crescer de uma grande nuvem de escuridao, quando ungoliant se elevava aos ceus consumindo tudo.</p> <p>Assim foram ca\u00e7ar Melkor e ungoliant, mas as arvores jaziam mortas e Yavanna poderia recupera las apenas a partir da luz das silmarils, que feanor nao quis dar. E mesmo querendo de nada serviria porque nelkor invadiu sua casa em Formenos e la matou seu pai o rei finwe, levando as silmarils consigo.  Ele prometeu a ungoliant tudo que ela quisesse, caso ainda tivesse com fome. E ela queria as silmarils, mas ele n\u00e3o queria abrir m\u00e3o delas, ent\u00e3o percebendo o seu plano de fuga a aranha prendeu melkor e estava prestes a devora-lo quando ele solta um horripilante berro, ecoando nos confins da terra e despertando seus antigos servi\u00e7ais, os Balrogs. Eles queimaram ungoliant com seus chicotes de fogo, e ela fugiu para as montanhas.</p> <p>Desse dia em diante ficou conhecido como Morgoth, e Feanor atou o destino de todos os noldor \u00e0s silmarils, jurando n\u00e3o descansar enquanto algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o eles as possu\u00edssem.</p> <p>Feanor liderou todos os noldor, junto com a hoste dos seus irm\u00e3os finarfin e fingolfin, para o norte seguindo a trilha de morgoth. Chegaram em fim ao norte e perceberam que n\u00e3o teriam como atravessar sem a ajuda de barcos, e por isso foram ter com o povo Teleri de Alqualonde, que aprenderam muito sobre o mar e o veneravam, sendo os melhores construtores de barcos que ja existiu. L\u00e1 feanor falou com Olwe, mas ele n\u00e3o aceitou ajudar os noldor, por receio de enfurecer os valar, e vendo que n\u00e3o seria possivel persuadi-lo, feanor atacou os Teleri e os massacrou, roubando os seus navios. Chegando ao norte viram uma grande figura negra em cima de uma montanha, e ela proclamou a maldi\u00e7\u00e3o dos noldor e avisou que estavam proibidos de voltar a valinor, que n\u00e3o teriam nenhuma ajuda dos valar, e que todos eles seriam traidos e morreriam tentando recuperar aquilo que desejavam.</p> <p>Ouvindo isso finarfin resolveu voltar e pediu perdao aos valar, reinando com o restante dos noldor em valinor. Mas fingolfin era resoluto e tomou o desafio para si, querendo mais do que nunca ir para a terra media e enfrentar feanor. Assim, com ajuda dos outros principes dos noldor, com finrod e galadriel, eles suportaram a longa marcha pelo norte gelado, perdendo muitos pelo caminho.</p> <p>Elwe e Melian cresciam cada vez mais em sabedoria e poder na terra-media. E seu povo ficou conhecido como Sindar, os elfos-cinzentos. Tiveram uma filha, L\u00fathien, a mais linda de todas as filhas de iluvatar. Habitavam em paz nas florestas de doriath, e tinham contato direto com os An\u00e3os do leste, vindos das montanhas azuis, as ered luin. Em Belegost e Nogrod eles habitavam, e vinham para Beleriand comercializar com os elfos. Pela amizade com o rei Elwe, que ficou conhecido como Thingol, o manto-gris, os an\u00e3os ajudaram os sindar a construir Menegroth, As Mil Cavernas. Era um grande complexo de tuneis escavados em um monte que se elevava proximo ao rio esgalduin, que cruzava a floresta.</p> <p>Rumores de seres malignos voltaram a aparecer, e os sindar decidiram se armar com ajuda dos ferreiros ananicos. Lutaram bravamente e recha\u00e7aram o avan\u00e7o dos orques pelo leste, mas perderam todas as terras ao redor de Menegroth, e assim Melian decide lan\u00e7ar uma barreira de prote\u00e7\u00e3o em volta de sua floresta de Doriath, fazendo com que s\u00f3 aqueles com permiss\u00e3o dela ou de thingol pudessem adentrar.</p> <p>Os valar ficaram em conselho por longo tempo depois que Feanor negou o seu perd\u00e3o. E decidiram ent\u00e3o ajudar a terra de Arda para a chegada dos Hildor, os homens, e melar os planos obscuros de Melkor. Assim yavanna e nienna gastaram suas energias para recuperar as arvores, mas delas nenhuma vida restava al\u00e9m de um ramo de Telperion e um fruto de Laurelin. E essas dadivas foram dadas a Aule, que fez vasos para honra-las. E manwe pediu para Varda colocar elas no ceu para assim iluminar a escuridao da terra media. A flor de telperion ficou conhecida como Isil, a lua, e o fruto de laurelin era Anar, o sol. Um ca\u00e7ador que amava a prata de telperion foi encarregado de puxar a carruagem de Isil, e uma maiar espirito de fogo se libertou e levou Anar para voar em volta da terra. Assim a lua e o sol come\u00e7aram seus ciclos.</p> <p>Temerosos com as investidas de melkor os valar elevaram grandes fortificacoes em volta de valinor, bloqueando todos os caminhos menos um, aquele que levava a cidade de Tirion ate as praias dos Teleri.</p> <p>Os noldor estavam cegos de raiva e perseguiram os orques por muitas leguas, mas por fim foram cercados e Feanor tombou, nao sem antes reafirmar que buscassem vingan\u00e7a. Assim Maedhros foi ca\u00e7ar os orques e acabou capturado, e posto em sofrimento na frente dos portoes de Angband, onde ficou por longo tempo at\u00e9 que Fingon veio salva-lo, e ele pediu para mata-lo, mas Thorondor surgiu, o rei das \u00c1guias, e levou fingon at\u00e9 maedhros, e conseguiu salva-lo cortando seu bra\u00e7o direito. Assim Maedhros aprendeu a lutar com a m\u00e3o esquerda e continuou a guardar O Marco de Maedhros, a primeira defesa contra angband.</p> <p>Turgon e finrod foram cavalgar para o sul e ao dormirem uma noite firam acordados por Ulmo, que os alertava sobre um lugar escondido para montarem seu castelo.</p> <p>Galadriel foi morar com o rei thingol em laurelin e aprendeu muito com Melian, e se apaixonou por Celeborn.</p> <p>Por s\u00e9culos depois da chegada dos noldor \u00e0 terra media houve paz e escaramu\u00e7as contra morgoth, que ficou recuado no seu forte e n\u00e3o fez avan\u00e7os, principalmente depois que Glaurung, o primeiro dos dragoes de fogo se revelou e foi recha\u00e7ado por Fingon, por ser ainda jovem e nao ter armadura completa.</p> <p>Finrod visitou Thingol e se maravilhou pelas cavernas de Menegroth, e abriu seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o ao rei, que contou sobre as cavernas de uma ravina sob o rio Narog, e l\u00e1, com ajuda dos an\u00e3os das montanhas azuis, finrod elevou sua fortaleza \u00e0 moda de Menegroth, e a chamou de Nargothrond. Ali Finrod fez seu lar, e ficou conhecido como Felagund, o escavador de cavernas.</p> <p>Turgon por sua vez ainda lembrava de Tirion, e assim foi levado por Ulmo sob as montanhas em um lugar secreto onde ele pudesse elevar sua fortaleza. L\u00e1 ele levou seus melhores artes\u00e3os, e assim constru\u00edram Gondolin, a rocha oculta. L\u00e1 ele e seu povo viveu em segredo, e ele n\u00e3o permitia a sa\u00edda de ningu\u00e9m. Mas sua irm\u00e3 Aredhel era de espirito forte e decidiu sair e cavalgar em busca dos principes noldor, seus amigos. Assim ela ficou em Hithlum esperando Celegorm. Como ele n\u00e3o vinha ela foi cada vez mais para o sul, at\u00e9 se perder nas matas de \u00cbol, o elfo escuro. L\u00e1 ele a desposou e fizeram um filho, Maeglin, que cresceu aprendendo os artificios dos anoes que passavam por l\u00e1, e com seu pai. Mas ficaram com vontade de ir para gondolin e Eol nao permitiu, entao fugiram mesmo assim e para la foram, com eol no seu encal\u00e7o. Eol chega em gondolin diante do rei Turgon e l\u00e1 foi recebido com boas vindas do rei, que o considerou parente e deixou viver com eles em gondolin, mas Eol era orgulhoso e tinha \u00f3dio dos noldor, pois tinha ouvido sobre o assassinato dos seus parentes, e assim conclamou que Maeglin deveria sair da cidade com ele. Mas turgon recusou, pois quem sabia o caminho ate gondolin ali deveria ficar, e com isso nao deu escolha para Eol, era ficar ou morrer. Depois de longo silencio, Eol de subito lan\u00e7ou um dardo na dire\u00e7\u00e3o de maeglin, querendo levar os dois a morte, mas Aredhel foi na frente e tomou o tiro, perecendo horas mais tarde do veneno contido nele. Eol ent\u00e3o foi julgado sem a misericordia de Turgon, e foi jogado de um precipicio perto da cidade. Maeglin continuou morando la e se tornou grande e poderoso dentre os gondolindrim, pois tinha alto conhecimento de ferreiro e fez as armas e armaduras de gondolin ainda melhores. Mas algo sombrio espreitava seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o, pois amava Idril, a filha de Turgon, mais que tudo, e ela n\u00e3o gostava dele, pois sentia algo de frio e dominante no seu ser.</p> <p>Depois disso, os homens come\u00e7am a chegar do leste, acordados quando o Sol subiu no c\u00e9u e atra\u00eddos pela luz de valinor. Finrod Felagund de Nargothrond estava ca\u00e7ando perto o rio Gelon quando ouviu uma m\u00fasica vinda de fogueira perto dali, os elvos-verdes ele sabia que nao acendiam tal fogo e nao parecia ser orques, ent\u00e3o se aproximou com cautela e se maravilhou com aqueles homens que ali viu reunidos em alegria por terem se desvencilhado dos horrores do leste, dominado pelos pesadelos de Morgoth. O lider daquele povo era Beor, e Finrod cantou para eles e se tornou adorado como um ser de sabedoria, pois cantou sobre o inicio de Arda e dos Valar. Depois os homens se espalharam pelas terras ao leste de doriath e ao oeste do rio Gelon, alguns sobre vassalagem de Caranthir no nordeste, outros na terra de hithlum com fingon e outros mais com finrod no oeste. Thingol n\u00e3o os aceitou, mas permitiu que morassem ao seu redor, e no oeste de doriath, a matriarca Haleth e seu povo morou, nas florestas de Brethil.</p> <p>Dias de paz vieram e Fingolfin n\u00e3o conseguiu convencer os elfos a se levantarem contra morgoth. Mas de subito num inverno sem sol morgoth se levantou, e lavou a planicie de aurd-galen com lava, matando muitos dos noldor que ali moravam. E ele se levantou, com o pai dos drag\u00f5es vermelhos, glaurung na vanguarda, seguido de balrogs e um enxame de orcs.</p> <p>Sem tempo de se defenderem Amrod e Amras pereceram, e muitos dos pais dos homens tamb\u00e9m, e os principes sobreviventes fugiram para o sul. Maedhros permaneceu e segurou sua fortaleza, pois com raiva e chama branca ele amedrontava todos no seu caminho. E vendo a ru\u00edna fingolfin achou que era o fim dos povos da sua gente, e com uma c\u00f3lera s\u00fabita cavalgou para os portoes de angband. L\u00e1 ele tocou sua trompa e clamou por Morgoth, chamando-o de senhor dos escravos e desafiando-o. Foi a ultima vez que morgoth saiu de seus portoes, e somou como sombra acima de de fingolfin, que luzia como luz prateada embaixo dele.</p> <p>Fingolfin acaba perecendo diante de Morgoth mas n\u00e3o antes de acerta-lo sete vezes com sua espada, e depois desse dia ele sempre mancou. Thorondor salvou seu corpo de ser destro\u00e7ado por morgoth e em cima de gondolin turgon fez seu t\u00famulo.</p> <p>De dor-lomin os homens continuavam lutando contra o poderio de angband e la os irmaos huor e hador fugiram com ajuda das aguias para gondolin, e viveram por um ano aprendendo com o rei turgon, depois voltando para sua gente.</p> <p>Em minas tirith sob o rio sirion Orodreth defendia o avan\u00e7o dos orques, mas o capit\u00e3o feiticeiro Sauron o destruiu com sua hoste de lobisomens, e de la ele lancou terror sobre toda doriath. E s\u00f3 n\u00e3o avan\u00e7ou sobre brethil com a ajuda de Beleg arco-forte, enviado do rei thingol de menegroth.</p> <p>Barahir e seus dez companheiros estavam vivendo em Dorthonion no norte e l\u00e1 eles ca\u00e7avam como mateiros todos os seres vis de Morgoth. E grande renome eles obtiveram. Ent\u00e3o Morgoth mandou seu capit\u00e3o Sauron para descobrir o esconderijo deles, e Sauron conseguiu, usando feiti\u00e7aria e truques para comprar a trai\u00e7\u00e3o de um dos companheiros de Barahir, e assim matou a todos no seu acampamento. O filho de Barahir, Beren, n\u00e3o se encontrava l\u00e1, e recebeu em sonho a imagem de uma arvore de corvos em um lago, onde vinha caminhando o amigo traidor avisando da sina do seu pai. Assim Beren pranteou e enterrou os ossos do seu pai, e ca\u00e7ou todos os orques responsaveis pela matan\u00e7a, recuperando assim o anel de Felagund que tinha sido dado com honra a Barahir. Ele ficou conhecido ent\u00e3o por ser amigo de todas as aves e bestas livres, e n\u00e3o mais as comeu, e foi posto uma recompensa sobre si n\u00e3o menor do que a dos reis dos Noldor. Sob as montanhas de Dorthonion ele contemplou Doriath e seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o o levou para l\u00e1, por terror e fome ele suportou as loucuras de sauron e as sombras de Ungoliant e suas crias. E descendo se enredou nas matas e ouviu a mais bela das filhas de iluvatar cantando e dan\u00e7ando na mata, Luthien, a que ele chamou Tin\u00faviel, a Rouxinol e filha do crepusculo. e por la eles se amaram e muitas vezes ficavam juntos escondidos, mas Daeron o menestrel os viu, e amando secretamente luthien ele por ciume contou tudo para o rei thingol, que se enraiveceu por saber que um mero mortal estava com a sua mais preciosa joia, a quem ele nao dava nem para os principes dos noldor. assim o rei chamou beren para sua presenca, e la ele o sentenciou a morte, dizendo que o preco pela sua filha era uma silmaril, a maior de todas as joias que repousava encrustada na coroa de morgoth. e assim beren foi, e indo para o Oeste chegou ate nargothrond, onde pediu ajuda para finrod felagund, amigo do seu pai, a quem devia as maiores honras. la ele conversou sobre seu destino e levantou grande furia dos irmaos noldor celegorm e curufin que la estavam hospedados. e jurados de morte foram beren e o rei finrod, que partiu junto com seus dez fieis seguidores, deixando as cavernas de nargothrond a mando de orodreth, a quem confiava. para o norte e dorthonion eles foram, emboscando orques e se disfarcando como eles usando feiticos do rei. mas Sauron os descobriu e suspeitou do seu avanco sem reportarem para superiores, e os trouxe Diante de sua torre, e la ele e o rei finrod batalharam com cancoes de poder, mas no fim a voz de Sauron foi mais forte ao utilizar o assassinato fratricida dos noldor nos dias de sua fuga de Aman. e assim foram presos e mesmo assim continuavam fieis, nao dizendo o objetivo de sua incursao, sendo mortos um por um pelos lobisomens. quando beren foi preso luthien sentiu grande temor em seu coracao e decidiu fugir para salva-lo, mas confiou em daeron e foi traida por ele, que contou ao rei thingol e fez com que ele fosse posta em uma grande casa em cima de uma arvore gigantesca, e de la ela nao podia sair. mas usou seu poder para criar um veu de disfarce e com feitico de sono passou pelos guardas, chegando assim ao norte e se deparando com os irmaos curufin e celegorm que la estavam cacando. celegorm estava acompanhado do chefe dos caos de caca, huan, o mais poderoso dos caes, vindo de valinor do proprio orome. ele farejou e descobriu luthien, que se mostrou para os principes dos noldor e foi aprisionada pelo interesse vil de celegorm, que esperava a morte do rei finrod para conseguir nargothrond e assim casar com luthien para conseguir tambem doriath. e por longos dias trancafiada em nargothrond ela conversava com huan, que se sentia arrependido e podia ver as sombras sob sua terra. e pelo amor que cresceu por ela ele falou pela primeira vez, ajudando ela a escaper. Huan estava destinado a falar apenas tres vezes, e perecer Diante do maior de todos os lobos do mal. assim eles foram ate a torre de Sauron e la luthien cantou chamando beren, que respondeu com pesar Diante do corpo de finrod, que deu sua vida para salvar a dele. e grandes lobos Sauron soltou contra eles, sendo abatidos por huan. ate mesmo o pai dos lobisomens, Draugluin, ele mandou, e longa e feroz foi a luta contra Huan, mas escapando do poder do grande cao ele fugiu de volta a Sauron e morreu aos seus pes, dizendo que huan estava la. assim Sauron foi ele mesmo disfarcado de lobisomem para combater aquele que so pereceria Diante do maior do lobos. E tao grande era sua forma de horror que huan saltou de lado quando o viu, e ele voou em direcao a luthien, que ficou paralizada de horror. mas huan conseguiu agarra-lo pelo pescoco e la ele foi pego, e sobreviveu apenas liberando a torre para luthien e assim fugiu sangrando. entao luthien derrubou a torre e salvou beren, retornando aquela terra a sua antiga gloria e enterrando la o rei finrod felagund. Pelas matas vagaram e encontraram curufim e celegorm, agora banidos de nargothrond pela descoberta de suas tramas de traicao. La atacaram beren e luthien, mas huan os salvou, traindo seu antigo mestre. Assim beren pegou a adaga magica de curufin, feita em valinor, e os mandou embora sem montaria. Partiram entao desfarcados de lobisomem e vampiro e chegaram diante dos portoes de angband, mas la se detiveram diante de um monstro jamais visto. Um gigantesco lobo criado por morgoth para matar huan: Carcaroth. Ele suspeitou dos dois e tomada por inspiracao dos valar luthien se despiu do desfarce e lan\u00e7ou um feiti\u00e7o de sono sobre o lobo. Assim ele dormiu e os dois passaram para dentro do portao. Foram at\u00e9 morgoth, que nao percebeu Beren mas sentiu luthien, e ela se mostrou para ele como uma oferta de can\u00e7\u00e3o e dan\u00e7a, e tomado por luxuria e malicia morgoth deixou que ela assim fizesse, sendo encantado por ela e caindo como uma avalanche e trov\u00e3o no ch\u00e3o, pois as silmarils na sua coroa estavam pesadas e penderam da sua cabe\u00e7a. Beren usou a sua adaga que tomou de curufin e cortou uma silmaril da coroa, e assim fugiram com o terror do despertar subito das hostes de angband. Mas no portao eles viram carcaroth desperto e furioso, e beren ergeu a silmaril com sua luz contra ele, mas tomado de grande fome o lobo gigante abocanhou m\u00e3o e pedra e arrancou fora. A silmaril come\u00e7ou ent\u00e3o a queimar o animal e ele partiu em loucura para o sul, destruindo tudo no seu caminho. Beren desmaiou e luthien usou o restante das suas for\u00e7as para tirar o veneno do lobo e estancar a ferida. Thorondor e duas aguias da sua familia foram ate la e salvaram os dois. Retornaram entao a menegroth e ao rei thingol, que reconheceu o poder de beren e o amor dentre ele e luthien. Mas ouvindo sobre como o grande lobo matava tudo no seu caminho e estava vindo para doriath uma companhia foi montada para dete-lo. E ca\u00e7ando ele foi que Huan enfim cumpriu sua sina, matando o monstro mas sendo ferido de morte. Beren salvou thingol mas tamb\u00e9m sofreu ferimento fatal, e os dois foram levados juntos ate doriath para serem velados com luthien. Ela ent\u00e3o foi caindo em sombras e enfim teve seu espirito enviado para os saloes de Mandos, e la ela fez a cancao mais poderosa de todas, comovendo at\u00e9 o imaculado Mandos, que deu a ela duas escolhas, esquecer tudo e viver sem magoas em valinor ou voltar com beren para terra-media e viver como mortal. Essa sina escolheu e assim foi que as duas gentes se uniram em uma das mais poderosas familias de Arda.</p> <p>Maeghlor decidiu juntar os povos para investir contra Angband, e Turgon abriu gondolin e refor\u00e7ou as hostes dos povos livres, mas n\u00e3o foi o suficiente para derrotar morgoth, que com a trai\u00e7\u00e3o dos homens sobrepujou os elfos, e muitos deles pereceram. Dentre eles o alto rei dos noldor, fingolfin, caiu diante dos balrogs de morgoth. E drag\u00f5es liderados por glaurung assolaram a regi\u00e3o, e teriam dizimado tudo n\u00e3o fosse os An\u00e3os de Belegost liderados por Azagh\u00e2l. Ele caiu diante de glaurung mas n\u00e3o antes de cravar sua l\u00e2mina na barriga da serpe. E turgon foi poupado pela bravura dos homens de H\u00farin e Huor, que seguraram a retaguarda enquanto ele conduzia sua retirada. Mas H\u00farin foi pego vivo e posto acorrentado sobre as Thangorodrim, de onde estava amaldi\u00e7oado a ver e ouvir todos os males impostos sob sua familia. Depois disso os noldor firam desbaratados e os orques avan\u00e7aram por toda beleriand.</p> <p>E assim Huor viu pela vis\u00e3o distorcida de Morgoth tudo o que aconteceu a seus filhos e a sua mulher, e depois sendo libertado vagou por doriath at\u00e9 que encontrou o colar de joias que fingolfin recebeu dos an\u00e3os. E levou at\u00e9 Thingol, que j\u00e1 estava de possa da silmaril que beren lhe deu e cada vez mais se sentia atraido por ela, e pediu para os anaos que ainda vinham ate ali negociar para que incrustacem a gema no colar. E os an\u00e3os se enamoraram da silmaril e em segredo combinaram de possui-la. Entao quando ficou pronto o colar disseram que nao iriam devolve-lo, e que pertencia a eles, e Thingol respondeu com escarnio e soberba, mandando os anaos embora. Mas eles se levantaram e ali mataram o rei Ellu Thingol, pela adora\u00e7\u00e3o da silmaril. Beren e Luthien viviam em ossiriand e ficaram sabendo da sina de doriath, e armaram uma emboscada, assassinando muitos anaos. Recuperaram o colar e ele reluziu em Luthien por longo tempo, transformando ela no ser mais lindo ja visto na terra media. Mas durou pouco tempo, e Dior seu filho recebeu a joia em Menegroth e soube que seus pais tinham partido. E agora os filhos de feanor se levantaram mais uma vez contra aqueles que tomaram posse da sua preciosa silmaril.</p> <p>Dior defendeu doriath at\u00e9 o fim, e sua filha Elwing levou a silmaril em fuga para os portos de Cirdan. Enquanto isso Tuor, filho de Huor, atendia a um chamado de Ulmo e vestiu a armadura escondida por turgon havia tempos. E de l\u00e1 seguiu at\u00e9 Gondolin com as palavras de Ulmo, avisando o rei para abrir mao da cidade oculta e partir para o mar do oeste. Mas ele se tornou soberbo e nao queria abrir mao da sua gloriosa cidadela, entao fechou os portoes e nao permitiu a saida de mais ninguem. Tuor ficou la por adoracao ao povo e a cidade, e cresceu o amor dele pela filha do rei, Idril. Mas Maeglos odiou ainda mais os dois, por desejo de possuir Idril. Por pressagio a princesa mandou criar uma trilha secreta para o norte, que se mostrou correta pois Maeglos foi capturado pelos orques, ao se perder dentro das minas. Morgoth ficou sabendo de Gondolin quando H\u00farin na sua loucura de desespero se virou para as montanhas de l\u00e1 e gritou bradando por turgon.</p> <p>Gondolin caiu diante do assalto de morgoth e Idril escapou com a ajuda de Glorfindel, tuor e das aguias de thorondor. Para o sudeste foram e se uniram com a gente de Elwin. L\u00e1 Elwin se casou com o filho de Idril e Tuor, Earendil, o marinheiro. E tiveram dois filhos, Elrond e Elros. Earendil ansiava pelo mar e por valinor, onde ouviu de Ulmo que residia a ultima esperan\u00e7a dos elfos. E para o oeste foi, e se perdeu, e decidiu voltar quando um pressentimento sombrio o atacou, pois os principes noldor Maedhros e Maglos (?) souberam da Silmaril com elwing e decidiram atacar, e destruiram tudo menos Elwing e seus filhos, que ela mandou para os cuidados de Gil-Galad enquanto ela mesma se jogava no mar com a gema sacra. L\u00e1 Ulmo a i\u00e7ou como uma grande ave e peloseu brilho Earendil a achou, e agora com a gema ele enfim chegou a Valinor. E la suplicou perdao pelas duas gentes para os valar, e eles entao se levantaram contra Morgoth. E acabaram com seu imperio, trancafiando-o no vazio. As silmarils foram roubadas pelos irmaos noldor, mas uma queimou a mao de maedros que caiu no fogo de lava e a outra Maeglos jogou no mar, e assim acabou o Quenta Silmarillion.</p>"},{"location":"lore/tolkien/silmarillion/#akalabeth","title":"Akalab\u00eath","text":"<p>Seus filhos, Elros e Elrond, puderam ent\u00e3o escolher a sua sina. Elrond decidiu seguir os Primog\u00eanitos e se tornou imortal, vivendo na Terra-M\u00e9dia com Gil-Galad. J\u00e1 Elros ficou devoto aos homens e assim seguiu sua sina, mesmo  vivendo muitas vezes mais do que os outros do seu povo. E aos seus seguidores foi presenteado com uma ilha magna, N\u00famenor, e se tornaram os D\u00fanedain, Numenoreanos, os maiores dentre todos dos povos dos homens. L\u00e1 eles cultivavam sabedoria com os Vanyar de Aman, e velejavam para todos os mares que lhe eram permitidos, desde que n\u00e3o se desvencilhassem muito ao oeste a ponto de n\u00e3o mais ver as praias de sua ilha. Pois estavam proibidos de buscar Valinor e o seu povo. Depois de muitos anos e muitos reinos, Numenor atingiu seu zenite, mas seus reis foram cada vez mais receosos de largar sua plenitude e abrir m\u00e3o do seu poder, sendo esperado que dessem para seus filhos e fossem viver o resto dos seus dias em paz. A isso foi atribuido a Melkor e Sauron, que lan\u00e7aram grande sombras de medo sobre a dadiva de iluvatar, a de que os homens deveriam viver e morrer, e assim os reis de Numenor come\u00e7aram a questionar e a ansiar pela vida eterna, mas de nenhum modo conseguiam eles mesmo fugir da morte. Se distanciaram cada vez mais dos ensinamentos e da adoracao dos Valar e de Eru, e se tornaram soberbos e com sede de poder, e desafiaram Sauron quando ele se proclamou senhor dos homens e da terra-media. Assim, no reinado de Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, as frotas de numenor navegaram para o leste e sobrepujaram Sauron, levando ele consigo de volta para a ilha como prisioneiro. Mas logo Sauron foi suavizando a todos com sua l\u00e1bia e seus conselhos s\u00e1bios e distorcidos, se elevando no conselho do rei e contando mentiras sobre os Valar e sobre o verdadeiro deus, que n\u00e3o era Eru mas sim Melkor o senhor do vazio, que prometia poder imensur\u00e1vel e novos mundos para conquistar. Assim o povo de Numenor foi dividido entre aqueles seguidores do rei, e aqueles ainda Fi\u00e9is aos valar, e dentre eles estava Amandil com seu filho Elendil, pai de Isildur e Anarion.</p> <p>E t\u00e3o grande era a influencia de sauron que ele mandou contruir um gigante templo no meio da cidade, com uma abertura no topo para a fuma\u00e7a de uma grande fogueira que queimava no centro. E a primeira chama que l\u00e1 ardeu foi a de Nimloth, a \u00e1rvore aben\u00e7oada que veio de um broto da Telperion, a \u00e1rvore sagrada dos Vanyar. Mas antes de corta-la isildur conseguiu se esgueirar e recolher um dos seus frutos, entregando para seu av\u00f4. Depois da arvore sacrificios humanos eram recolhidos em adora\u00e7\u00e3o a Melkor, e todos os fi\u00e9is fugiram para a terra media ou foram recha\u00e7ados para as costas do leste da ilha. E onde antes os numenor chegavam como deuses ate os povos da terra-media, compartilhando sabedorias e tecnologia, agora eles vinham mais como conquistadores e pilhadores, tomando impostos e tudo que queriam, e come\u00e7aram a fazer escravos. Depois de certo tempo Sauron convenceu Pharazon de que os Valar e o seu povo dos Vanyar eram os inimigos, e que estavam enganando os homens para nao partilhar a dadiva da vida eterna. Assim se levantaram em uma imensa frota de navios de guerra, capaz de escurecer o horizonte com suas proas negras e ambar, e mesmo sem vento foram em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao oeste, sacrificando a vida de seus escravos nos remos. Chegando enfim at\u00e9 l\u00e1 viram o esplendor da terra de Aman, mas os Valar se recolheram e deram palavra a Eru, que abriu um vazio no mar capaz de sugar tudo e todos para dentro, separando para sempre a terra media das ilhas abencoadas do oeste. E l\u00e1 toda a frota numenoreana caiu, e junto dela foi a ilha de Numenor, com todo o seu povo junto. Mas alguns sobreviveram, e na terra-media fizeram grandes feitos, mesmo sendo apenas resquicios daquele tempo dourado de numenor, que agora ficou conhecida como Akalab\u00eath, A Deca\u00edda.</p>"},{"location":"lore/tormenta/l1-inimigo-do-mundo/","title":"O Inimigo do Mundo","text":"<p>O livro come\u00e7a descrevendo A Ordem Morta da Vid\u00eancia e Numerologia.

No fim o mago rufus sai da taverna com uma garrafa de vinho misturada com a droga alucin\u00f3gena local achbud. </p> <p>O grupo chega na capital de Ahlen, Thartann, Na noite das m\u00e1scaras onde a maior festa do ano acontece e eles v\u00e3o disfar\u00e7ados em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao pal\u00e1cio para ver o regente. Ficaram sabendo que o Albino matou 6 prostitutas, dissecando elas depois que ele ouviu numa taverna sobre o regente estar com sua mulher gr\u00e1vida. </p> <p>Apenas Ashlen, Vallen, rufus e ellisa foram mascarados para o palacio, artoruios kodai e nichaella foram pelos esgotos, pois a cidade e todo o reino s\u00e3o intolerantes contra n\u00e3o-humanos. </p> <p>Artorius, Kodai e Nichaela est\u00e3o nos esgotos indo at\u00e9 o pal\u00e1cio. Antes disso resgatam um bardo dos guardas da cidade. O bardo Senomar diz que vendeu a alma para p demonio para tocar bem o alaude e diz que estava sendo raptado para tocar para o regente de Ahlen, Lorde Thorngald Vorlat. </p> <p>O Albino chega num pr\u00e9dio alto e pomposo onde um banquete est\u00e1 sendo servido. A dona do lugar \u00e9 uma velha chamada Fiona. Que sabe quem ele \u00e9 e oferece comida e explica\u00e7\u00f5es sobre \u201ccomo se faz um rei\u201d. Depois diz que pode resolver suas perguntas mas que ele deve ir pessoalmente pegar o novo rei da barriga da m\u00e3e. </p> <p>O grupo chega at\u00e9 onde eles podem ir como pessoas comuns, ent\u00e3o matam os guardas e roubou suas roupas. Agora Ashlen e Ellisa v\u00e3o disfar\u00e7ados de guardas em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos aposentos do rei.</p> <p>Eles s\u00e3o descobertos e lutam pelas suas vidas. Ellisa d Ashlen conseguem entrar nos aposentos do regente e fazem sua esposa de ref\u00e9m. S\u00e3o abordados pelo pr\u00f3prio Thorngald que decide ajud\u00e1-los a ca\u00e7ar o albino. </p> <p>Gl\u00f3rienn e a deusa da natureza Allihanna v\u00e3o visitar Oceano, o deus dos mares. Pedem que ele n\u00e3o interrompa a tempestade que est\u00e1 por vir. Azgher, o deus sol invade a reuni\u00e3o e tenta convencer Oceano a impedir o desastre que a tempestade trar\u00e1, mas Oceano se mant\u00e9m firme. </p> <p>Vallen e Gregor passam pelas terras da familia Vahn, e Gregor tenta em v\u00e3o mostrar seu valor para sua m\u00e3e e irm\u00e3, mas \u00e9 Vallen que tenta mostrar isso quando d\u00e1 um esporro neles. </p> <p>Na dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Cohlen e no rastro do albino o grupo se depara com um exercito de Thyatis na estrada, sendos liderados por Roderick, um amigo de Gregor e tamb\u00e9m um paladino de Thyatis. Nichaela pede para acompanharem o exercito pois eles tambem estao indo para o sul e eles precisam da ajuda dela, pois s\u00e3o um exercito de garotos inexperientes. </p> <p>O exercito estava no rastro de um grupo de goblinoides que vinha fazendo caos na regi\u00e3o, e depois de algum tempo de viagem eles foram emboscados pelas criaturas. O exercito se desesperou na sua tentativa de fuga e foi Artorius e Masato Kodai que sozinhos revidaram, matando dezessete goblins antes que eles fugissem e desistissem de saquear as carro\u00e7as do exercito que ficaram para tr\u00e1s. </p> <p>Gregor parte em busca de refor\u00e7os enquanto os goblinoides se preparavam para a luta. Eles limpam o campo de batalha e formam uma parede de escudos, algo incomum para goblins normalmente desordenados e inexperientes. </p> <p>O exercito de Thyatis est\u00e1 sem esperan\u00e7as e seu l\u00edder sente quando seu deus lhe toma seus poderes de paladino. Masato vai falar com ele e tira pela primeira vez da bainha sua adaga pequena de seppuku, que tem o poder de mostrar no seu reflexo como algu\u00e9m vai morrer. Roderick olha no reflexo e sai do torpor de desesperan\u00e7a, recuperando sua for\u00e7a e instigando o fogo no cora\u00e7\u00e3o dos seus homens. </p> <p>Artorius, vallen e masato avan\u00e7am sozinhos em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 parede de escudos goblinoide e se aproveita de um feiti\u00e7o de ch\u00e3o escorregadio que Rufus conjura, matando varios inimigos. O exercito humano tamb\u00e9m avan\u00e7a mas logo est\u00e3o caindo e morrendo junto com os goblins, que est\u00e3o se reorganizando. Ellisa est\u00e1 flutuando e usando o ofuscar do sol para disparar flechas certeiras nos lideres goblins, e Nichaella espera nos cantos da batalha para curar os feridos. Logo caem os tr\u00eas guerreiros e muito do exercito, quando roderick avan\u00e7a com seu cavalo desferindo golpes n\u00e3o letais mas amputando varios membros e incapacitando varios goblins, at\u00e9 que enfim vem a lan\u00e7a nas suas costas e ele finalmente morre, na situa\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica prevista de acordo com as leis de Thyatis. Assim ele realmente morre e uma fenix surge do seu corpo, revivendo todos os guerreiros para o combate e queimando os goblins. A luta estava tomando outro rumo e assim surge Gregor com os refor\u00e7os. </p> <p>Gregor estava em disparada quando foi alcan\u00e7ado pelos goblins montados em wargs, e vai sofrendo flechadas e curando seu cavalo tentando chegar na cidade mais proxima. Ele quase desmaia quando percebe que asas surgiram do seu corcel, que agora voa em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao sol. </p> <p>Enquanto isso um esquisito guerreiro e paladino de Anilatir, a deusa da inspira\u00e7\u00e3o se encontra com o albino, que o convida a segui-lo para conhecer sua deusa e amante. O albino decide segui-lo pois precisa encontrar a torre da bruxa para reportar aos seus superiores, mesmo reconhecendo a falta de informa\u00e7\u00f5es uteis. Mas quando descobre que Anilatir era uma mulher mortal que foi transformada em deusa menor a partir da venera\u00e7\u00e3o, ele finalmente achou o que buscava, e sua miss\u00e3o foi um sucesso. </p> <p>Ellisa cai do feiti\u00e7o de flutua\u00e7\u00e3o no meio dos goblins e \u00e9 espancada enquanto mata varios deles. Vallen v\u00ea isso e vai enfurecido salvar sua amada. Ele pega ela nos bra\u00e7os e foge para a floresta, largando suas espadas m\u00e1gicas enquanto um grupo de goblinoides o perseguem. Quase morto de exaust\u00e3o e carregando Ellisa eles se deparam com uma torre branca no meio da floresta, um santu\u00e1rio de Marah, a deusa da paz. Enquanto isso o resto do grupo tenta reastrear eles e por fim consegue. </p> <p>No templo de Marah descansam e descobrem que o albino passou por ali, e contou para a cl\u00e9riga Demilke que cuida do lugar sobre seu plano, ir para uma ilha no sul encontrar uma bruxa numa torre. </p> <p>Tenebra \u00e9 a deusa das trevas, e ela visita o reino celestial de Ragnar, o Deus da Morte dos goblin\u00f3ides, e l\u00edder da alian\u00e7a negra. Ela vai at\u00e9 o deus bugbear e avisa ele sobre a tempestade que gl\u00f3rienn est\u00e1 tramando, e assim consegue uma alian\u00e7a tanto com ragnar quanto com a deusa dos elfos. </p> <p>O grupo chega na torre da bruxa Andaluzia e n\u00e3o encontram nada la dentro, at\u00e9 que s\u00fabito o mundo deles vira dor e come\u00e7am a ser torturados por ilus\u00f5es. </p> <p>Eles est\u00e3o pindurados em jaulas no teto da torre da bruxa, em agonia. Rufus foi o unico a perceber que o albino esta ali, mas n\u00e3o fala nada. </p> <p>Rufus era um mago aprendiz que ficou viciado em achbuld e fazia parte de uma trupe deplor\u00e1vel de circo, fazendo alguns feiti\u00e7os para crian\u00e7as impression\u00e1veis, mas um dia acabou trocando o feiti\u00e7o de um raio de gelo por uma bola de fogo, pois n\u00e3o queria sentir a dor de esquecer do feiti\u00e7o, e assim acabou acidentalmente matando algumas pessoas nas arquibancadas, foi linchado da cidade e s\u00f3 sobreviveu porque se escondeu por acaso na casa da m\u00e3e de Vallen, que o protegeu e depois o chamou para o grupo de aventureiros, curando-o do vicio. </p> <p>O albino deu um livro a rufus, ele o l\u00ea em segredo. O p\u00e9 de Ashlen est\u00e1 apodrecendo e ele \u00e9 obrigado a anputa-lo. Ficaram l\u00e1 por quatro meses, sendo torturados pela bruxa sem rosto. Ela argumenta com seres invisiveis sobre ter feito todas as vontades \u201cdele\u201d, por ter aprisionado seus inimigos, e pede por algo que n\u00e3o recebe. </p> <p>Rufus finalmente desvenda os segredos de uma p\u00e1gina do livro, e consegue libert\u00e1-los das gaiolas. Ele enxerga artefatos m\u00e1gicos num canto e indica aos companheiros, que pegam e fogem da torre da bruxa. Gregor ficou com um escudo m\u00e1gico de Azgher, o deus do sol, e dos olhos da figura ele revelava a verdade. Ashlen pegou uma capa que o transformava em um grande morcego. Ainda tinham uma ferradura e um c\u00e1lice que n\u00e3o sabiam seus poderes. </p> <p>Foram ent\u00e3o para Wynla, o reino da magia, e l\u00e1 se encontraram com Seraphine, uma feiticeira que conseguiu identificar os itens magicos e ia levar os aventureiros por magia at\u00e9 o seu pr\u00f3ximo destino: o artefato de Helladarion, maior item de Tanah Toh, a deusa do conhecimento, que era capaz de responder qualquer pergunta. </p> <p>Na casa da feiticeira Ashlen se despede do grupo e volta para sua casa e sua familia em Valkaria. </p> <p>O artefato Helladarion era o sumo sacerdote de Tanah Toh, e ficava na Caverna do Saber, escondida no reino de Yuden, conhecido pelo seu exercito e sua cultura militar, onde todo e qualquer alde\u00e3o era um guerreiro. Eles eram o segundo maior exercito de Arton, perdendo apenas para o de Deheon, o reino capital. Em Yuden eles odiavam todo e qualquer estrangeiro e n\u00e3o humano, e por isso o grupo decidiu viajar evitando todo e qualquer contato. </p> <p>Mas depois de duas semanas de viagem estavam sem provis\u00f5es, e foram obrigados a entrar numa vila para pedir comida. Apenas os humanos foram l\u00e1, deixando Artorius, Nichaela e Kodai escondidos nos arredores. Vallen, Gregor e Ellisa entraram no sal\u00e3o do lorde e tiveram que lutar com v\u00e1rios advers\u00e1rios para provar seu valor, mas quando enfim iam conseguir comprar as ra\u00e7\u00f5es um mensageiro informa que eles estavam acompanhados de n\u00e3o-humanos. </p> <p>Com isso uma luta generalizada contra toda a aldeia come\u00e7a e eles s\u00f3 fogem gra\u00e7as a um escudo de paz que Nichaela conjura, mas n\u00e3o antes de perderem Kodai, que foi capturado. Eles fogem at\u00e9 a floresta onde se deparam com a Caverna do Saber. </p> <p>Parece que o albino se uniu com Yuden e todos est\u00e3o se reunindo na cidade de Galienn para uma cerim\u00f4nia, que os aventureiros pretendem ir atr\u00e1s, mas v\u00e3o deixar Kodai a merc\u00ea dos yudenianos, provavelmente virando sacrificio. </p> <p>Rufus tenta abordar ellisa dizendo que vallen est\u00e1 fraco e arrogante e que ele iria valorizar mais ela. Ellisa s\u00f3 o xinga e o despreza. </p> <p>Nichaella amea\u00e7a sair do grupo pois n\u00e3o aguenta mais mortes e Artorius promete \u201cser ele mesmo\u201d. Nichaella parece satisfeita. </p> <p>Vallen bebe no c\u00e1lice m\u00e1gico que pegaram na torre da bruxa e percebe como a bebida curou suas feridas e seu cansa\u00e7o, al\u00e9m de agu\u00e7ar seus sentidos. </p> <p>O sumo sacerdote de Keen se chama Arsenal e \u00e9 um monstro coberto por armadura. Eles estavam reunidos em Gallien para homenagear p albino como o Dan\u00e7arino da Guerra, o que traria a guerra para toda Arton. Mas os aventureiros salvam Kodai do enforcamento e lan\u00e7am a luz reveladora do escudo de Azgher no albino. Que depois de Rufus anular sua prote\u00e7\u00e3o profana revela sia verdadeira face, um inseto alienigena horrivel. </p> <p>Os 5 mil guerreiros e soldados de Yuden fogem ou desfalecem perante o horror da vis\u00e3o do albino inseto, apenas Arsenal e os aventureiros permanecem, devido ao liquido do calice sagrado. </p> <p>A luta \u00e9 r\u00e1pida, e os aventureiros conseguem enfim matar o forasteiro alien\u00edgena. Os ex\u00e9rcitos de yuden estavam se recuperando do estado de choque causado pelo albino e avan\u00e7avam contra eles quando Arsenal, o sumo-sacerdote de Keen interveio, e os salvou, teletransportando a todos para perto da cidade de Irina, onde sua aventura come\u00e7ou. E assim terminou sua miss\u00e3o de vingan\u00e7a. </p> <p>Keen se encontra com Arsenal no seu reino de guerra e manda o sumo sacerdote ajudar Gl\u00f3rienn e seus aventureiros a fazer acontecer a sua tempestade, e depois visita Megalokk, o deus dos monstros, lutando ferozmente com ele durante dias para tamb\u00e9m mand\u00e1-lo ajudar gl\u00f3rienn e sua tempestade. </p> <p>Com o albino morto, os aventureiros se despediram e se separaram. Artorius foi atr\u00e1s de uma guerra que fosse requisitado, gregor foi para Cohleen atr\u00e1s dos seus parceiros de thyatis, rufus foi para samburdia estudar magia, e nichaella e masato kodai foram para o templo de Lena onde a filha de nichaela morava. </p> <p>Vallen e Ellisa estavam indo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a Valkaria e ao pr\u00f3ximo calabou\u00e7o com tesouro, sentindo-se livres e jovens. </p> <p>Enquanto isso irina finalmente descansou depois de saber que foi vingada.</p> <p>Rufus estava de volta a sua velha casa na fazenda dos Domat. Seus pais j\u00e1 haviam falecido e a casa estava abandonada, a n\u00e3o ser pelas baratas e o mofo. Mesmo assim ele se sentiu confort\u00e1vel e finalmente sozinho. Misturou um pouco de achbuld com vinho e foi para seu mundo perfeito de alucina\u00e7\u00f5es. Mas ele durou pouco, porque subitamente surge diante dele o albino, deixando Rufus subitamente s\u00f3brio. </p> <p>O albino queria ir para casa e fez rufus ouvir por semanas a descri\u00e7\u00e3o do reino de horror de onde ele saiu, e depois de tr\u00eas meses sendo prisioneiro ele conseguiu abrir o portal, e todo o sofrimento daqueles ultimos dias pareceu o para\u00edso perto do vislumbre do inferno que era o reino do albino. </p> <p>Vallen e ellisa recebem uma carta de rufus e decidem reunir o grupo novamente. </p> <p>O grupo encontrou rufus e o alojou na casa dos vizinhos. Ele estava magro e velho, falando incoerencias que levou dias para nichaela entender, e assim eles partiram em busca de alguem que soubesse abrir um portal para o inferno do albino. </p> <p>Vallen n\u00e3o queria mais ser o lider do grupo pois julgava ter errado demais, ent\u00e3o eles foram a um clerigo de nimb (ou khalmir) capaz de fazer um ritual de troca. O novo lider tirado no papelzinho foi Gregor. </p> <p>Rufus num belo dia come\u00e7ou a suar vermelho e vomitar lacraias gigantes da boca. </p> <p>Hyninn o deus dos ladroes e da trapa\u00e7a convocou os deuses para uma reuni\u00e3o no reino de Khalmir, o deus da justi\u00e7a e da ordem. L\u00e1 ele suplicou que deixassem a tempestade de gl\u00f3rienn acontecer, e convenceu todos os deuses a aceitarem. Khalmir percebeu tarde de mais que a convoca\u00e7\u00e3o ter sido feita justamente no seu reino significava que o maior trapaceiro iria conseguir enganar a todos, mas no fim concordou que seria interessante haver a tempestade. </p> <p>Gregor decide que eles devem atravessar as montanhas uivantes e eles partem para Giluk, a cidade da sua antiga companheira Andilla. Eles s\u00e3o atacados por hobgoblins do gelo e salvos por uma druida rude chamada espirito-de-pedra. A druida os chama de chifres-verdes e os manda irem embora pois l\u00e1 n\u00e3o \u00e9 o seu lugar, mas ao saber que s\u00e3o amigos da filha do chefe de Giluk decide os ajudar relutantemente. Artorius se sente ofendido e aposta com a druida ao dizer que vai chegar \u00e0 cidade sem sua ajuda, e sem suas roupas tamb\u00e9m. </p> <p>O grupo foi falar com dente-de-urso, o chefe da vila Giluk. Eles deram a ferradura encantada que tinham pego na torre da bruxa e deram de presente ao chefe. Da ferradura desceu dos c\u00e9us um cavalo espl\u00eandido com Andilla nas costas. Ela disse que estava feliz e que o cavalo permitiria ela viajar pelos reinos dos deuses, n\u00e3o mais presa ao reino que foi depois da morte. </p> <p>Com essa visita o chefe agradeceu os aventureiros e os levou at\u00e9 a catedral de gelo, uma masmorra que tinha no seu interior o portal para o inferno. Descendo l\u00e1 eles se depararam com uma forja min\u00fascula cheia de diabretes.</p> <p>Os diabretes aceitaram trocar informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o albino em troca de tesouros, ou materiais para que eles pudessem forj\u00e1-los. Assim em troca de informa\u00e7\u00e3o Vallen trocou sua coragem, sua juventude e seu amor. Agora um velho medroso que n\u00e3o passava de um colega de grupo para Ellisa. </p> <p>Os diabretes os levaram para o reino do albino, explicando que ele fazia parte de um lugar al\u00e9m do mundo material e dos deuses, e podia ser considerado um demonio para os demonios, um ser lascivo e aterrorizante, que fazia os demonios parecerem meros camponeses indefesos. </p> <p>O universo do albino era alienigena demais e nada fazia sentido, deixando o corpo e a mente dos aventureiros em frangalhos. Ao chegar l\u00e1 o albino os esperava, e contou para eles os planos dos seres onipotentes que eram. </p> <p>Eles haviam sido criado pelos deuses, mas evolu\u00edram tanto a ponto de dominar todo o universo, e mataram todos os deuses. Nada mais tinham para conquistar e evoluir, e com o t\u00e9dio come\u00e7avam a decair em guerras internas. Assim em busca de um objetivo eles foram enviados para outros universos a fim de descobrir algo novo, e o albino achou isso em Arton, a capacidade de se tornar um deus ao ser venerado e poderoso o suficiente. E esse era o plano daqueles seres alienigenas e insetoides, se tornarem deuses, algo que ainda ningu\u00e9m tinha feito. </p> <p>O albino brincava cruelmente com os aventureiros, jogou Ellisa num penhasco e quebrou o pesco\u00e7o de Vallen com um pis\u00e3o. Mas n\u00e3o contava com aquilo que possibilitava justamente o que eles buscavam em Arton, a for\u00e7a dos esp\u00edritos dos seres daquele reino, algo que era indescritivelmente forte e milagroso. E por isso o albino foi morto, mesmo quebrando os chifres e desmembrando os bra\u00e7os de Artorius, e decapitando Gregor, Kodai conseguiu por fim matar o albino, mas sem que antes pudesse descobrir de onde viria o ataque: em Petrynia, numa praia perto de Adolan. </p> <p>Os l\u00edderes daquele mundo ent\u00e3o se enfureceram e concordaram em mudar os planos, de ascens\u00e3o a deuses para a vingan\u00e7a, e prometeram destruir todo o universo de Arton. </p> <p>Kodai e Nichaela levaram Artorius e Gregor de volta para Arton, e surgiram em algum lugar de Fortuna. O navio do Ca\u00e7\u00e3o Cego estava l\u00e1 com a capit\u00e3 Izzy e Rufus, agora um ser inchado que de semanas em semanas expelia um enchame de insetos. Esses insetos estavam indo para Petrynia onde um ritual era realizado, mas Kodai e Nichaela conseguiram interromper. </p> <p>Meses depois em tamu-ra kodai e nichaela iam se casar, mas ao olhar na sua espada kodai viu que ia morrer naquele dia, vitima da tormenta vermelha dos insetos que invadiam o reinado. E ali morreram os dois juntos, e acabou a hist\u00f3ria, dando in\u00edcio a tormenta. </p>"},{"location":"lore/tormenta/l2-cranio-e-corvo/","title":"O Cr\u00e2nio e o Corvo","text":"<p>A hist\u00f3ria come\u00e7a com uma dupla de bandoleiros e o seu bando atacando uma tropa reduzida de cavaleiros de Khalmyr.

O que eles n\u00e3o sabiam era que Vincent e Justin foram tocados pela tormenta, depois de serem picados por algum inseto e agora com manchas vermelhas, febre e alucina\u00e7\u00f5es os deixando fortes e bestiais. </p> <p>Orion \u00e9 um humano servindo de cavalari\u00e7o para Ulam, o general de um forte em Trebuk. Os amigos de Orion eram um an\u00e3o chamado Ingram e um centauro chamado Trebane, e eles estavam reunidos no sal\u00e3o quando Ashlen Ironsmith chega esbaforido e desmorona. </p> <p>Trebane lhe ajuda a se recuperar com suas t\u00e9cnicas dru\u00eddicas e Ashlen diz que o maior ca\u00e7ador de recompensas est\u00e1 vindo, Cr\u00e2nio Negro, e com ele vem um ex\u00e9rcito. </p> <p>Orion organiza a defesa e eles lutam na chuva forte que cai fora da fortaleza. O ex\u00e9rcito de cranio negro eram barbaros, homens agigantados cobertos por peles e com o corpo exposto, brandindo machados de guerra e com manchas vermelhas pelo corpo. Manchas que na verdade pareciam uma carapa\u00e7a dura de besouro, pois n\u00e3o eram meros b\u00e1rbaros, mas sim homens tocados pela tormenta. </p> <p>Orion matou v\u00e1rios com sua espada e escudo, Ingram, o an\u00e3o, tinha um rifle e duas pistolas que fez trovejar p\u00f3lvora, e trebane matava com sua longa foice, seus cascos de cavalo e suas magias da natureza advindas de Allihanna, deusa da natureza. </p> <p>Mas a\u00ed chegou Cr\u00e2nio Negro e a batalha acabou, ele era leve como uma pena e mortal como a morte, usando duas espadas finas e curvadas ele derrubou orion, perfurou ingram e cortou trebane. Mas Ashlen gritou para eles de uma passagem lateral, e mesmo abatido Ingram conseguiu acertar o ca\u00e7ador de recompensas com um tiro de rifle, atordoando-o o suficiente para escaparem para dentro do forte. </p> <p>Ashlen diz que achou uma passagem secreta e eles fogem para l\u00e1 com os soldados sobreviventes. Mas CN logo os descobre e manda seus b\u00e1rbaros atr\u00e1s deles. Ao chegarem perto eles s\u00e3o explodidos por uma armadilha, trebane incendeia o tunel e faz explodir a polvora de ingram, e assim eles fogem, CN morre e depois de uns dias volta a vida, pois \u00e9 imortal e a morte n\u00e3o significa nada. </p> <p>Orion exige respostas de Ashlen e assim ele conta como voltou para sua casa em Valkaria e como seus irm\u00e3os e seu pai decidiram o seu destino como \u201cRH\u201d do imp\u00e9rio de ferreiros da familia Ironsmith. Mas Ashlen n\u00e3o queria nada disso e passava os dias bebendo com prostitutas. </p> <p>Certo dia Ashlen \u00e9 confrontado pelo seu irm\u00e3o e decide se vingar indo at\u00e9 o baile nobre que haveria naquela noite. Ele faz uma algazarra e insulta a anfitri\u00e3, que o prende numa cela embaixo do castelo.</p> <p>Uma mo\u00e7a malabarista que estava se apresentando no baile o aborda dizendo que tinha uma oportunidade pra ele, e o liberta sem que o guarda ao menos perceba a presen\u00e7a dele. </p> <p>Ela diz que \u00e9 de uma guilda de ladr\u00f5es e assassinos sem nome que triunfa ao usar e ensinar pessoas aleijadas e desinteressantes, aproveitando das suas doen\u00e7as e dificuldades para realizar seus trabalhos de forma anonima. Ashlen paga ent\u00e3o pelo treinamento, e depois de um ano ele finalmente aprende, mas a guilda ent\u00e3o some e ele n\u00e3o consegue encontra-la mais. Depois de um ano e sem saber o que fazer com suas habilidades novas ele acorda um dia e percebe que est\u00e1 cego. </p> <p>Tateando pela mans\u00e3o da familia ele descobre que seu pai e seus irm\u00e3os est\u00e3o todos mortos, e tenta fugir de algu\u00e9m quando \u00e9 capturado por uma armadilha. Um homem o tortura por informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre seus antigo bando de aventureiros, querendo saber onde estavam e quem era o mago que andava com eles. Ashlen aproveita da tortura para dissimular espasmos de dor e assim se livrar das amarras e das algemas que o prendiam. Ele ent\u00e3o consegue fugir e assim segue at\u00e9 agora, sem parar por muito tempo em um mesmo lugar, desafiando o Cr\u00e2nio Negro ao sobreviver e escapar da persegui\u00e7\u00e3o. </p> <p>Vanessa \u00e9 uma cl\u00e9riga de keen, o deus da guerra, e est\u00e1 gr\u00e1vida.

Subitamente ela sente que a magia de paralisia se desfez, e ela consegue chegar ate sua ma\u00e7a e arrebentar a lateral da cabe\u00e7a do paladino. </p> <p>Era o m\u00e9dico que havia conversado com ela na taverna mais cedo. Ele havia neutralizado o feiti\u00e7o e agora ajudava Vanessa. Ela conseguiu dar conta de todos e ainda humilhar a cleriga anci\u00e3 ao for\u00e7\u00e1-la a apunhalar Vanessa pelas costas para salvar suas duas novi\u00e7as, o que resultou no abandono de sua deusa, e numa vit\u00f3ria de Keen. </p> <p>O m\u00e9dico era Zebediah Nash, do col\u00e9gio real de m\u00e9dicos de Salistick, um reino de ateus que abandonou os deuses e por isso desenvolveu a ci\u00eancia mais avan\u00e7ada que existia, com medicina avan\u00e7ada. Ele pede para acompanhar vanessa porque n\u00e3o quer pensar nos seus pr\u00f3prios problemas, e pergunta pra onde ela estava indo. </p> <p>Vanessa diz que est\u00e1 indo atr\u00e1s do pai do seu filho, Orion Drake, porque ele \u00e9 um tolo que n\u00e3o vai ver o filho nascer, e porque ela o ama. Diz que por sua vez Orion est\u00e1 em uma miss\u00e3o para encontrar seu pai, para provavelmente mata-lo. </p> <p>Orion e o seu grupo finalmente saem dos tuneis subterraneos para um dia ensolarado nas redondezas de Trebuck. Ele decide ent\u00e3o ir at\u00e9 o Ex\u00e9rcito do Reinado, milhares de homens que rodeiam a \u00e1rea devastada pela tormenta. </p> <p>L\u00e1 no ex\u00e9rcito os homens est\u00e3o cada vez mais impacientes e desertando com frequ\u00eancia, pois lady Shivara Sharpblade havia sumido fazia tr\u00eas semanas, e no seu lugar estava um homem apraz\u00edvel chamado Thomas Yerick. </p> <p>Thomas estava matando quem perguntasse por Shivara, estava fazendo incurs\u00f5es para dentro da Tormenta onde todos morriam e, ultimamente, estava possuido pela tormenta e cuidando de ovos de insetos que ele chama de filhos. </p> <p>Ele mostrou para seu segundo em comando, Lawrence, e fez o inseto entrar dentro do seu ouvido e tomar o seu corpo, possuindo seu amigo e dizendo que em breve conhecer\u00e1 o seu novo mestre. </p> <p>Orion est\u00e1 carrancudo na sua barraca e n\u00e3o da conversa para Ingram. Ele est\u00e1 pensando em como sei pai, o Cavaleiro Risonho, um homem misterioso que em um torneio na cidade-sede da Ordem da Luz chamada Norm, venceu todas as justas e fez a cabe\u00e7a de todas as donzelas. Recebeu titulo de campe\u00e3o e compareceu ao baile no fim do dia, sem tirar a armadura, sem comer nem beber, apenas dan\u00e7ou com as damas e tirou lady Serbina Drake para dan\u00e7ar. A dama era uma nobre baronesa de Siegfred, e se viu arruinada depois de ser encontrada ainda b\u00eabada e indecente. O Cavaleiro Risonho sumiu e nunca mais foi visto, mas a familia Drake virou um p\u00e1ria e Orion nasceu com a morte de sua m\u00e3e, um bastardo que sempre era lembrado disso, mas que cresceu com honra e foi adotado pelo Alto Comandante Philipp Donovan. Logo virou um cavaleiro honrado e se casou com Vanessa, uma cl\u00e9riga de Keen que tamb\u00e9m abdicou de sua familia nobre. Os dois tinham um castelo e viviam felizes, mas Orion n\u00e3o podia aceitar ver seu filho nascer com a mancha na honra da familia Drake, e por isso ele foi atr\u00e1s do seu pai. </p> <p>Enquanto pensava em tudo isso, Ingram e Trebane caminhavam pelo acampamento e perceberam que estavam sendo escoltados como \u201cprisioneiros de honra\u201d, pois podiam fazer o que quisessem, menos ir embora. No outro dia tinha o julgamento de Ashlen, e uma garota misteriosa chamada Zara Lysande disse que ia salvar Ashlen, \u201cporque eles eram quase casados\u201d. Ela era uma nobre que tentou argumentar que conhecia Ashlen desde pequenos e que acusar ele era acusar toda a familia Lysande. Mas isso n\u00e3o adiantou e o juiz Thomas Yerick sentenciou Ashlen, Zara e toda sua familia a morte. </p> <p>No outro dia chegava Cr\u00e2nio Negro, pisoteando um lisonjeado Thomas Yerick e exigindo ver Ashlen. </p> <p>Ashlen libertou todos os seus companheiros e Orion liderou os ex\u00e9rcitos leais do reino contra os soldados corrompidos do general. O cavaleiro destruia fileiras de inimigos atras de Cr\u00e2nio Negro, enquanto Trebane lutava contra Thomas Yerick. O general quase derrotou o centauro, mas no fim foi sobrepujado pelas criaturas de Allihanna que o druida soltou pra cima dele. Orion ainda procurava CN quando viu um clar\u00e3o de magia, e resolveu tentar se aproximar do mago, pois eles eram muito vulneraveis em combate corpo-a-corpo. Mas ouviu ent\u00e3o uma mulher gritando para Keen e soube que era sua mulher. Vanessa estava matando todos com sua ma\u00e7a, mas na sua frente uma po\u00e7a de sangue dizia que havia algo al\u00e9m da matan\u00e7a, ela estava em trabalho de parto. </p> <p>Como que ouvindo o desespero dos dois, um cavalo branco e majestoso que tinha fugido do acampamento alguns dias atr\u00e1s quando o general Thomas havia tentado mont\u00e1-lo agora retornava, pisoteando e mordendo os soldados que rodeavam Orion e Vanessa. Orion monta o garanh\u00e3o e foge com Vanessa para a floresta, onde uma batalha \u00e9 travada entre a cl\u00e9riga e seu pr\u00f3prio corpo. A crian\u00e7a estava sufocando por causa do cord\u00e3o umbilical, mas Orion consegue corta-lo a tempo e logo ela come\u00e7a a berrar seu desafio ao mundo. </p> <p>Enquanto isso Ashlen rasteja desesperado e se depara com Cranio negro na sua frente, acompanhado de uma maga estranha e sem rosto, e \u00e9 finalmente capturado. Lady Shivara Sharpblade voltou ao acampando vendo o caos no meio das suas fileiras e leva suas tropas contra os corrompidos. </p> <p>Acharam planos de guerra escondidos na tenda de Thomas, parece que Cr\u00e2nio Negro tem um exercito na Uni\u00e3o P\u00farpura e planeja avan\u00e7ar contra Trebuck. Orion, Vanessa e Trebane decidem ir at\u00e9 Bielefeld pedir ajuda dos ex\u00e9rcitos da Ordem da Luz, e Ingram e o Dr. Zebediah Nash decidem ir atr\u00e1s do Cavaleiro Risonho, que mandou uma carta para Orion dizendo que entregava de presente para ele o cavalo branco, Bandido, o melhor cavalo do reino de Namalkah. Trebane encontra Zara e combina com ela de ela ir junto com eles para Bielefeld. </p> <p>Cr\u00e2nio negro caminha pela \u00e1rea de tormenta em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao forte Amud, onde o lorde da tormenta Gatzavlith fez sua morada. A \u00e1rea de tormenta \u00e9 descrita de forma detalhada, com um horror indescrit\u00edvel. Aqui descobrimos que Cr\u00e2nio Negro n\u00e3o \u00e9 nem humano e nem da tormenta, ele veio do vazio, e tem um novo mestre, e vai trair Gatzavalith. </p> <p>Sir Justin Gheralt est\u00e1 em Norm, a capital da Ordem da Luz em Bielefeld. E l\u00e1 ele levou os amigos bandoleiros Darien e Vincent. Darien estava preso enquanto sir Justin decidia se ele era \u201caben\u00e7oado\u201d ou n\u00e3o, enquanto Vincent recebia treinamento militar e ouvia e decorava os ensinamentos de Khalmir e da Ordem da Luz. Aprendendo tamb\u00e9m seu novo objetivo, corromper a Ordem para a Tormenta. </p> <p>Ashlen est\u00e1 preso em Grael, a cidade sem tribo, unico local santu\u00e1rio para as inumeras tribos barbaras que lutavam pela uni\u00e3o purpura. L\u00e1 o atual l\u00edder e \u201ctormentado\u201d Guryann espera seu oponente para decidir quem continuar\u00e1 como \u201cregente\u201d, um posto sen prest\u00edgio criado quando as tribos tiveram que se submeter ao resto do reino. </p> <p>Ashlen acompanha escondido um ritual de sacrif\u00edcio ao deus dos monstros, Megalokk. Os xam\u00e3s e druidas das tribos cantam, dan\u00e7am, enquanto monstros surgem e se refestelam no sangue e na carne dos sacrif\u00edcios, com um representante de cada ra\u00e7a inteligente de Arton. Depois da matan\u00e7a os monstros continuam brigando entre si, at\u00e9 que surge dentre eles um minotauro enorme e tomado pela tormenta. Era Artorius, o cl\u00e9rigo de Tauron e antigo companheiro de aventura de Ashlen. Ele pega uma coroa de ossos e carne do meio do lago de sangue e coloca na cabe\u00e7a, proclamando ser o novo rei da Uni\u00e3o P\u00farpura. Ashlen pergunta o que Tauron, o deus da for\u00e7a, estava fazendo subjugando Megalokk, o deus dos monstros, mas n\u00e3o sabemos se ele sabe que Artorius agora segue o deus da tormenta. </p> <p>Orion, vanessa, trebane e zara entram em Norm sendo recebidos pelas festividades do torneio. Norm \u00e9 a cidade exemplo dos humanos, nobre, orgulhosa e justa, sede da Ordem da Luz e basti\u00e3o dos homens. </p> <p>Orion primeiro se encontra com seu velho amigo Bernard Branalon, um guerreiro forte e robusto, do tipo felizardo e fanfarr\u00e3o, meio besta, meio homem. Tem v\u00e1rios filhos e se acha amaldi\u00e7oado por causa das mortes das \u00faltimas 6 mulheres com quem ficara junto.</p> <p>Depois Orion se encontra com o Alto Comandante Alenn Toren Greenfeld, e conversam sobre o torneio, vincent e justin, e orion comenta sobre justin ser um traidor, tanto Alenn como Bernard acham que sim, mas n\u00e3o acham que seja da tormenta. Depois falam sobre a iminente guerra conta a uni\u00e3o p\u00farpura e cranio negro, e Alenn obriga Orion a liderar os exercitos. Enquanto isso Vanessa se encontra com sua amiga Camille, uma cl\u00e9riga de Khalmyr e amiga de inf\u00e2ncia. Depois, naquela noite, orion e vanessa se deitam e sonham com ashlen e seu antigo grupo, e decidem por o nome do seu filho de Vallen, um nome que ambos ouviram no sonho. </p> <p>Artorius desafia o atual l\u00edder das tribos e se torna o Rei. Mas por tr\u00e1s do semblante indom\u00e1vel, ele desmorona ao se reencontrar com Ashlen, que conta como ele foi salvo por cranio negro,  se transformando de um mendigo sem bra\u00e7os para um forte e orgulhoso cl\u00e9rigo da tormenta. Ainda assim, Artorius Rex est\u00e1 chorando, perguntando por que Ashlen n\u00e3o o salva. </p> <p>Parece que CN quer encontrar todos aqueles que sobreviveram, e por isso est\u00e1 ca\u00e7ando Rufus e Gregor. </p> <p>Zara e Trebane passeiam pelos acampamentos enquanto Orion fala com Darien. O rapaz admite tudo e confessa que foi sir Justin que matou os cavalari\u00e7os e servi\u00e7ais. E orion faz dele seu cavalari\u00e7o, dizendo que essa seria sua puni\u00e7\u00e3o. </p> <p>Do outro lado do reinado Ingram e o dr nash viajam para Namalkan e passam por Callistia, uma regi\u00e3o cortada por rios. Na capital dessa regi\u00e3o eles investigam rumores de criaturas do mar matando prostitutas, e descobrem que na verdade s\u00e3o homens-monstro, nobres que pagam para o Gr\u00eamio dos M\u00e9dicos Monstros para virarem mutantes monstruosos. </p> <p>Come\u00e7ou as justas, combates de cavalo com lan\u00e7as longas. Parecia s\u00f3 mais um evento mas o cavaleiro risonho apareceu, e orion era puro odio. Darien entrou nas li\u00e7as, lutas a p\u00e9 e no estilo cada um por si. Vanessa venceu a li\u00e7a derrubando darien e brannon. Cavaleiro risonho derrubou o filho do rei, cegando-o, e tamb\u00e9m vincent, que caiu no chao para evitar transparecer a carapa\u00e7a de inseto que estava saindo no bra\u00e7o machucado. No fim orion lutou contra seu pai e com odio mortal parecia te-lo matado, ao usar uma lan\u00e7a com ponta de a\u00e7o. Mas o cavaleiro sumiu, deixando armadura vazia no ch\u00e3o onde tr\u00eas dados rolavam. </p> <p>Zara vai com Trebane no baile e \u00e9 desmascarada, na verdade era uma serva que pegou o nome da dama ao qual servia quando ela morreu em uma emboscada de orcs. Orion briga com vanessa pq ela quer que ele fique com o beb\u00ea Vallen, ele diz que \u00e9 pra ela ficar, mas ela diz que tem uma miss\u00e3o secreta de Keen.  No fim nenhum dos dois cede e ele acaba ficando com Branalon em Norm, enquanto Orion lidera os exercitos sob seu novo estandarte, um corvo negro sob fundo branco. </p> <p>Nash e Ingram estavam em Tyros investigando os homens-monstros quando a cidade flutuante de Vectora chegou. Eles foram at\u00e9 l\u00e1 e descobriram a sede do Gr\u00eamio dos M\u00e9dicos Monstros. L\u00e1 eles d\u00e3o cabo dos homens-monstro, com a ajuda de Lorde Blimey I, o rei dos mendigos. </p> <p>O exercito da tormenta est\u00e1 na verdejante terra de Samb\u00fardia, e precisam passar pela floresta das escamas verdes, lar dos dragoes verdes, cuspidores de veneno e acido, que ficam invisiveis. L\u00e1 CN mata um deles e depois negocia a passagem do exercito en troca de sua vida. Os dragoes aceitam e estra\u00e7alham o ca\u00e7ador de recompensas, dando passagem para o exercito. CN volta a vida em seguida. </p> <p>Vanessa viaja para Yuden, o exercito com uma na\u00e7\u00e3o, e recebe a visita de um estranho que diz ser responsavel pela criacao das armas de fogo. Ele diz onde tem uma vila que vanessa procura, mas depois dela dormir vai la e corta um olho dela fora com uma adaga. Ela acredita que a informacao valeu um olho. </p> <p>Ashlen tava sendo torturado por cranio negro de novo. Artorius foi falar com ele e acabou recobrando a sanidade, desafiando CN para um duelo. Acabou morrendo, mas antes disso libertou Ashlen das correntes, e com isso ele conseguiu se esgueirar at\u00e9 Andaluzia, a bruxa cega que prendeu todo o grupo anos atr\u00e1s, e a respons\u00e1vel pela queda de Ashlen. Ele estava pronto para mata-la mas viu dentro do portal que ela abria a torre onde fora capturado, e l\u00e1 havia um prisioneiro, era Rufus. </p> <p>Vanessa bota a vila de volta nos eixos ao confrontar o seu chefe farsante, e assim consegue uma conferencia com o rei de yuden, Mitkov. </p> <p>Darien se junta a uns escudeiros e trocam hist\u00f3rias sobre Orion, enquanto Bernard ouve dos seus filhos sobre como sir Justin \u00e9 \u201caben\u00e7oado\u201d. </p> <p>Ingram e Nash est\u00e3o no reino dos cavalos, Namalkah. Eles encontram uns cavaleiros que desafiam Nash para uma corrida e ele vence com graciosidade. Em seguida aparece o tropeiro que os cavaleiros serviam, e era tio do doutor, Xavier Nash. </p> <p>Vincent e os seus seguidores simbiontes atacam Norm. Bernard acorda e vai ver como est\u00e1 seu filho menor, mas descobre a cl\u00e9riga Camille morta. Vai correndo ver como est\u00e1 Vallen e v\u00ea seu filho Malcolm com a crian\u00e7a no colo, dizendo que vai mat\u00e1-la. Eles lutam e Bernard v\u00ea seu filho matar seu irm\u00e3o no colo dele, entra em f\u00faria e mata Malcolm, com Vallen ainda vivo. Ele chega at\u00e9 a torre da ordem da luz e se junta com o comandante Alenn Greenfeld, convencendo-o a fugirem. </p> <p>Ashlen vai at\u00e9 a torre da bruxa e vence os horrores e a insanidade para salvar Rufus. </p> <p>Zara estava para ser morta na arena de Valkaria, mas trebane a salva. </p> <p>Ingram est\u00e1 com os nash e conta sua hist\u00f3ria. Ele foi banido de Deheonn, o reino dos an\u00f5es, por trair a guilda dos armeiros, quando se juntou a um grupo que cultuava Tenebra, a deusa das trevas, e escondidos forjaram as armas de fogo. Os amigos se tornaram vampiros e fugiram, mas ele n\u00e3o, ficou e encarou a senten\u00e7a, banido de Deheonn, foi para a superf\u00edcie com sua amada, Nadia, uma s\u00facubo que foi invocada para atrair Ingram para o culto mas que acabou se apaixonando por ele. </p> <p>Juntos estavam em Portsmouth seguindo o rastro dos vampiros, quando encontraram um an\u00e3o velho que era menosprezado como um eterno aprendiz, que foi enredado no grupo dos vampiros mas n\u00e3o era pr\u00f3ximo o suficiente para se tornar um deles. Ingram acaba deixando o an\u00e3o ficar com eles s\u00f3 para acordar com ele mordendo seu pesco\u00e7o, e perceber que ele tinha sugado o sangue de sua amada, que acabou voltando para o reino de Tenebra, de onde tinha fugido por desobedecer a deusa. </p> <p>Ingram se vinga dos antigos amigos vampiros e sai cambaleando pela noite quando esbarra com Orion, que o acalenta e o coloca de volta no caminho, deixando o an\u00e3o em uma suposta d\u00edvida com o cavaleiro. </p> <p>Trebane est\u00e1 com Zara numa casa esconderijo e ele conta para ela sobre como conheceu orion. Ele era uma homem e tinha um irm\u00e3o druida, que estava em forma de cavalo e prestes a morrer. Orion convenceu trebane a irem no olho de thyatis, um vulcao adormecido lendario. L\u00e1 orion empurrou os irm\u00e3o, e trebane renasceu como um centauro druida. Ele termina de contar e se sacrifica pra salvar Zara, que \u00e9 resgatada pela malabarista e aceita se juntar a guilda dos ladroes de ashlen. </p> <p>Ingram e Nash adentram uma \u00e1rea dominada por Nimb, o deus do caos. L\u00e1 uma vila sem sentido sobrevive no absurdo e eles se dirigem at\u00e9 onde o Cavaleiro Risonho o espera, junto com um unic\u00f3rnio negro, um hipogrifo e o sumo-sacerdote de Nimb, Dee, um palha\u00e7o com uma ma\u00e7a feita de doce.</p> <p>Ingram e Nash adentram uma \u00e1rea dominada por Nimb, o deus do caos.

Assim ele instiga as tropas a lutarem por arton, e n\u00e3o o seu reino, sua cidade ou afilia\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>Cranio negro chega em Pondsmania e trava uma batalha feroz contra as fadas. Em um momento chama a rainha e a desafia para uma partida de xadrez. E vence na terceira tentativa, usando sagacidade e seu conhecimento sobre a rainha e o reino das fadas. Mas \u00e9 tarde demais, ele chega em trebuck atrasado, com Orion e bielefeld a sua frente.</p> <p>Orion e cr\u00e2nio negro organizam as tropas, Bernard chega e conta dobre Vincent, enfurecendo Orion, que manda Darien para a linha de frente da guerra como soldado, largando o jovem a pr\u00f3pria sorte.  </p> <p>Vanessa chega por tr\u00e1s do ex\u00e9rcito de cr\u00e2nio negro com 40 mil soldados de Yuden.</p> <p>Vanessa foi a respons\u00e1vel por unir trebuck e yuden sob shivara sharpblade e mitkov yudenach, e assim levando os 40 mil homens para a retaguarda da uniao purpura de CN.  </p> <p>Capit\u00e3o greenfeld e xavier nash lideraram as duas cargas de cavalaria pelos flancos do exercito da tormenta, enquanto orion, vanessa e bernard lideravam a parede de escudos.  </p> <p>O terror das cargas fez aflorar o lado selvagem e desesperado dos b\u00e1rbaros corrompidos, e nem toda disciplina ensinada por Artorius foi o suficiente para eles manterem a forma\u00e7\u00e3o. Quebraram e avan\u00e7aram contra a parede de escudos, para j\u00fabilo do ex\u00e9rcito do reinado.  </p> <p>Orion acaba sendo puxado por um b\u00e1rbaro gigante e enxerga cranio negro fugindo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \u00e1rea de tormenta, chamando-o para o combate. O ca\u00e7ador de recompensas diz que n\u00e3o quer lutar, mas Orion quer, e os dois avan\u00e7am, mas na hora de se chocarem orion grita por vanessa e seu filho vallen, e esse nome faz cranio negro se desestabilizar, confuso e agoniado, ele leva o golpe de orion e continua fugindo, Bandido vem at\u00e9 orion para ajud\u00e1-lo na persegui\u00e7\u00e3o</p> <p>Os lordes da tormenta invadem as mentes e corpos de todos ali presentes. Primeiro Gatzvalith passa como uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o corporal de for\u00e7a, depois Aharadak invade a alma dos soldados com uma vontade irresist\u00edvel de adora\u00e7\u00e3o, agora Igasehra transmite um sentimento de inutilidade, de desespero, dizendo que seus titulos e for\u00e7as n\u00e3o s\u00e3o nada, e que no fim nada restar\u00e1, nem mem\u00f3rias e nem almas.</p> <p>Vanessa comanda as tropas, berrando para manterem a forma\u00e7\u00e3o. Xam\u00e3s da uni\u00e3o p\u00farpura revivem os mortos para lutarem por eles, mas ao chamado de vanessa um grupo de cl\u00e9rigas de Lena, a deusa da vida, faz com que os mortos-vivos fujam.  </p> <p>Mais um sentimento da tormenta invade a todos, fazendo homens simplesmente morrerem, travarem ou enlouquecerem, enquanto os lefeu ficam mais insetoides, parem para adorarem ou explodem o seu simbionte, matando o hospede.</p> <p>Vanessa comanda as tropas, berrando para manterem a forma\u00e7\u00e3o.

Os diabretes forjaram a armadura e elmo do que ela nomeou como cranio negro.  </p> <p>Orion vive infeliz no seu castelo, briga com bernard e depois sai com ingram e darien atr\u00e1s de cranio negro, no deserto de cinzas de Sckharshantallas, reino do dragao Sckhar.  </p> <p>Darien estava antes disso em roschfallen vivendo como guarda da milicia da cidade.</p> <p>Orion, ingram e darien est\u00e3o em sckharshantallas e vivenciam um festival bizarro em homenagem ao rei, o dragao sckhar. Eles atacam e aprisionam dois dragoes prateados, conhecidos por serem bondosos e justos.  </p> <p>Antes disso, Darien em roschfallen vive como miliciano e \u00e9 abordado por um an\u00e3o cheio de joias. Ele tenta roubar o an\u00e3o mas se d\u00e1 mal e \u00e9 obrigado a pagar para ter de volta seu apito e sua ma\u00e7a de miliciano. Depois, descobre que o an\u00e3o faz parte da guilda dos ladr\u00f5es e o ensina como trapacear e enganar lordes.</p> <p>Darien pergunta para seu tutor an\u00e3o Thulbok se ele n\u00e3o acha cruel o que fizeram com o cavaleiro enganado, e ele explica que na verdade estava ajudando a preservar a ordem da luz, e que caso n\u00e3o fosse roubado de toda sua fortuna seu filho iria sair em uma expedi\u00e7\u00e3o com seus companheiros cavaleiros e seria assassinado por um traidor, ent\u00e3o na verdade rouba-lo foi um favor a ele mesmo.</p> <p>Thulbok leva darien para conhecer seus amigos. Em um por\u00e3o de uma casa de vinhos ele conhece Crawford, Jannen e Ambrose, esse \u00faltimo um estudioso insano que conta uma conspira\u00e7\u00e3o maluca mas que termina por cair sobre o paradeiro de Cr\u00e2nio Negro. Ele diz que o ataque da tormenta em trebuck foi um engodo dos lordes da tormenta para enganar cranio negro e assim destirp\u00e1-lo do que restava de sua humanidade. Ele ainda n\u00e3o sabe. Porque mas tudo o leva a crer que CN precisa do sangue do maior drag\u00e3o vivo, e esse drag\u00e3o \u00e9 Sckhar.  </p> <p>Thulbok diz que \"o jogo \u00e9 ajudar a ordem dos cavaleiros da luz sem que eles saibam\", e por isso Darien precisa ir at\u00e9 Orion e convenc\u00ea-lo sobre esses fatos.</p> <p>Orion observa enquanto um homem desafia o rei sckhar dizendo ser tamb\u00e9m um drag\u00e3o. Ele \u00e9 posto num poste junto com os outros sacrif\u00edcios e parece ser parente de uma elfa que tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 l\u00e1.  </p> <p>No meio do discurso de sckhar surge gregor e ellisa. Gregor abre a costura do seu pesco\u00e7o e tira uma espada sanguessuga de dentro do buraco da garganta, joga pra ellisa e ela usa na elfa, sugando seu sangue. Orion v\u00ea isso e dispara contra ela, mas ela e gregor conseguem fugir com o sangue da elfa.  </p> <p>Orion tenta atacar sckhar mas \u00e9 salvo pela magia da elfa, que teletransporta todo o grupo para um lugar seguro.  </p> <p>O homem \u00e9 edauros, e a elfa \u00e9 sua irm\u00e3, yadallina. Ambos s\u00e3o drag\u00f5es de prata.</p> <p>Orion e o grupo perambulam quase mortos no deserto at\u00e9 que encontram uma \u00e1rvore, e chegando l\u00e1 um lago. Orion desmaia e os outros descansam, finalmente acabando com a sede.  </p> <p>Subitamente aranhas brotam aos borbot\u00f5es de dentro do lago, enrolam orion e o levam para o centro. Correndo atr\u00e1s delas descobrem que o lago na verdade tinha uma ilus\u00e3o, e uma casa de madeira podre repousava no centro. L\u00e1 encontram Pai e M\u00e3e, dois druidas de allihanna dos animais carniceiros, dos insetos e dos vermes. D\u00e3o abrigo para eles e curam todas suas feridas. Orion levanta depois de alguns dias, sem um bra\u00e7o, mas com for\u00e7a renovada. Ele sonha com vanessa e com Nikaela, que fala pra ele sobre Ellisa e sobre Vallen Allond.  </p> <p>Vanessa acorda numa masmorra pensando sobre seu sonho com orion.</p> <p>Ashlen escala a montanha sangrenta do drag\u00e3o com gregor, rufus, ellisa e andaluzia. L\u00e1 em cima ellisa despeja o sangue da elfa e assim come\u00e7a um massacre. Diversas criaturas se juntam e com elas diversos drag\u00f5es diferentes, de todas as cores, come\u00e7am a se matar. Depois disso as montanhas parecem expelir do seu interior um drag\u00e3o gigantesco, vermelho e coberto de olhos, antenas, chifres e pelos, o dragao da tormenta.</p> <p>Orion e seu grupo chegam perto das ru\u00ednas de hazzond e wazzond, e yadallina os alerta sobre ser uma cidade fantasma que atrai aventureiros durante a noite mas que some durante o dia, voltando para o reino de tenebra, a deusa das trevas. Ao ouvir isso ingram imediatamente diz que devem ir at\u00e9 l\u00e1. Chegando l\u00e1 veem uma cidade fantasma pr\u00f3spera e efervescente, e ao olharem para si mesmo veem um futuro possivel, onde ingram tem barba e broches da guilda, darien tem vincent do lado, os irm\u00e3os elfos s\u00e3o principes e orion \u00e9 exatamente igual.  </p> <p>Enquanto isso Gl\u00f3rienn, a deusa dos elfos, caminha pelo seu reino desolado, triste e decadente. \u00c9 visitada por Tauron e ele a instiga a mostrar pra ele sobre o vermelho, a area de tormenta que invade seu reino. Ele tenta convencer a deusa a entregar seus dominios para o deus da for\u00e7a e seus suditos.</p> <p>Orion e edauros conversam enquanto as cidades fantasmas somem e os mortos vivos surgem da terra. Edauros explica que Len\u00f3rienn, o reino dos elfos, caiu para a Alian\u00e7a Negra dos goblinoides devido \u00e0 natureza elfica de ser passivos, pac\u00edficos e de vida longa, prezando muito pelas artes e coisas belas da vida, desprezando outros prazeres que os goblinoides aproveitam, reprocria\u00e7\u00e3o e guerras mort\u00edferas.  </p> <p>A cidade some menos a taverna e outras constru\u00e7\u00f5es maiores. Ingram e os outros se reunem com os dois e enquanto o sol se p\u00f5e um sol escuro surge no c\u00e9u, englobando a regi\u00e3o com um circulo de escuridao, o reino de tenebra. O anao corre ate la mas \u00e9 puxado por orion e os outros, que correm para fora da escuridao.</p> <p>Rei e rainha mitkov de yuden recebem a visita do rei-imperador e o alertam sobre o dragao da tormenta, orion e seu grupo chega l\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m.  </p> <p>Em Valkaria no bairro de Nitamura, \u00e1gata trabalha numa taverna. Ela \u00e9 meio-elfa filha de nichaela e kodai, e tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 contaminada pela tormenta. Desde pequena recebe visitas dos lefeu, que fazem experimentos no seu corpo e mudam seus orgaos. Ela consegue construir coisas com a energia da tormenta e estava usando isso para alimentar os goblins que moram nas favelas de valkaria. Num certo dia aparece Ellisa e diz que ela deve ir com ela. Orion se encontra com Mitkov, que o convida a presenciar sua companhia de elite em a\u00e7\u00e3o, enquanto oferece ajuda para encontrar o Cavaleiro Risonho</p> <p>Orion \u00e9 convencido a aceitar os modos de vida de Yuden, e aceita o convite de Mitkov. Ele aceitar\u00e1 ajuda para encontrar Vallen, e ir\u00e1 para Bielefeld ensinar a disciplina Yudeniana para o Exercito do reinado e da ordem da luz.  </p> <p>Tauron, o deus da for\u00e7a, visita Tanah-Toh, a deusa do conhecimento, atr\u00e1s de respostas sobre a tormenta. Ela diz que veio de Gl\u00f3rienn e dos pr\u00f3prios deuses, mas sugere uma liga\u00e7\u00e3o com o maior mist\u00e9rio de Arton, sobre a Revolta dos Tr\u00eas, quando Valkaria, a deusa da humanidade, se rebelou com Trillion(?) e o Terceiro. Ningu\u00e9m sabe o que foi a revolta, s\u00f3 a puni\u00e7\u00e3o da mesma: Valkaria transformada em est\u00e1tua, Trillion em mortal e o Terceiro esquecido.</p> <p>O dragao da tormenta ataca a cidade de Tallban, que fica pr\u00f3xima das montanhas sangrentas. L\u00e1 nasceu o maior dos magos, Vectorius, lorde supremo da cidade voadora de Vectora. Ele lutou contra o drag\u00e3o, mas s\u00f3 conseguiu enrolar por um tempo enquanto salvavam quem restava da cidade.</p> <p>Orion e Ingram s\u00e3o capturados e levados at\u00e9 Doherinn, o reino dos an\u00f5es. Na capital Doher eles s\u00e3o recebidos pelo rei, o sumo sacerdote de Khalmyr e pelo mestre da guilda dos artes\u00f5es. Pedem ajuda dos dois para recuperar a espada sagrada de Khalmyr, que foi roubada de Doher e est\u00e1 com CN.  </p> <p>Elisa, Ashlen e Gregor estavam no Deserto da Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o, Elisa conquistando o principe Tuarin, e Ashlen invadindo o palacio do sult\u00e3o Faz\u00fbd. Darien diz que CN esta no dederto da perdicao. Orion descobre entao que ele pretende achar um portal para outro reino ou dimensao, e assim matar um deus Edauros e yadallina exploram as montanhas sanguinarias e sao chamados por um dragao azul.  </p> <p>Orion treina darien e um batalhao de cavaleiros da luz no estilo BOPE. O imperador Thormy conversa sobre o dragao da tormenta com Vectorius e o mestre arcano Talude. Queriam saber de Orion mas n\u00e3o conseguiram nada.  </p> <p>Edauros e Yadallina conversavam com o drag\u00e3o azul anci\u00e3o Delaraxos, e conseguiram convencer a revoada dos azuis a ajuda-los a ca\u00e7ar o dragao da tormenta</p> <p>Ellisa conclui seu plano, ela, ashlen e gregor fazem os irm\u00e3os do deserto se unirem, abrindo m\u00e3o da l\u00e2mpada m\u00e1gica que era sua heran\u00e7a e sua desaven\u00e7a. Trocaram ela com Ellisa, que deu o poder de \u00c1gata para eles. \u00c1gua, florestas, pr\u00e9dios e at\u00e9 um novo sol, tudo criado com o poder lefeu da serva de elisa. Em troca, ellisa usou os matematicos e astrologos da cidade no deserto para prever onde o proximo portal iria se abrir.  </p> <p>Com a lampada ela tinha direito a tres desejos, com o primeiro fez com que o genio voltasse a lampada, depois pediu para desfazer seu casamento com o principe, e com o ultimo desejou Vallen.</p> <p>Ellisa e gregor invadem o reino de glorienn sob o dragao da tormenta. Orion e os corvos montam os dragoes azuis que edauros e yadallina trouxeram. Ellisa corta a barriga de rufus e ele expele uma area de tormenta que toma conta do reino, glorienn se esconde e joga os elfos do seu reino contra os invasores, matando todos. Gregor avan\u00e7a contra ela com a espada de khalmyr nas m\u00e3os mas n\u00e3o a mata, entrega pra ela a espada e diz para ela lutar, mas ela foge, sendo escravizada por Tauron, o deus da for\u00e7a, e se tornando uma deusa menor.  </p> <p>Seu reino vira o caos e \u00e9 tomado pelos lordes da tormenta, que tomam seu posto no pante\u00e3o.</p> <p>Vanessa est\u00e1 no encal\u00e7o do cavaleiro risonho, que raptou o seu filho. Ele est\u00e1 velho e ela est\u00e1 cada vez mais perto, mas ao encontr\u00e1-lo se depara com mais algu\u00e9m: cr\u00e2nio negro. O cavaleiro chega at\u00e9 ellisa e entrega Vallen, dizendo que \u00e9 filho de orion e que ele o odeia. Ellisa se pergunta se esse foi o ultimo desejo ao g\u00eanio. Ela luta contra vanessa e os yudenianos que a assistiam e vai embora com Vallen, enquanto Bandido leva Vanessa para Zakharov.  </p> <p>O mundo de Arton se desespera com a queda de Gl\u00f3rienn, e todos sentem algo faltando, um vazio que \u00e9 preenchido com devo\u00e7\u00e3o fan\u00e1tica e sem sentido, at\u00e9 que algo preenche o vazio, \u00e9 Aharadak, o deus da tormenta. Orion foi levado a julgamento na ordem da luz e est\u00e1 sendo acusado de omitir informa\u00e7\u00f5es que poderiam ter salvo glorienn. Ningu\u00e9m na ordem da luz se acha certo em julgar orion, ent\u00e3o ele mesmo faz e se considera culpado.  </p> <p>Enquanto isso os lordes da tormenta de reunem no antigo reino de glorienn para decidir o que fazer. Ighared se torna o lorde do reino e deixa seu antigo posto para cr\u00e2nio negro, que finalmente recebe sua recompensa em Tamu-ra, um espa\u00e7o s\u00f3 seu com o antigo grupo reunido, o beb\u00ea Vallen, Ashlen, gregor todo estripado, rufus inchando novamente, e o fantasma de Nichaela e Kodai, pais de \u00c1gata, a respons\u00e1vel por criar todas as coisas que Ellisa desejar.</p> <p>Yadallina foi capturada por minotauros escravagistas que veneram Tauron o deus da for\u00e7a. Levam ela at\u00e9 uma mans\u00e3o onde un leil\u00e3o ir\u00e1 acontecer. Ela conversa com outro elfo, que se diz feliz por estar ali, que antes Gl\u00f3rienn os abandonou e que agora tinham um significado de novo.  </p> <p>Logo Darien e os corvos chegaram e extrairam yadallina com sucesso, com a ajuda de edauros e os dragoes azuis. Nos dias seguintes aparecem dez drag\u00f5es brancos, que se curvam perante a elfa. Yadallina e edauros viajam com os dragoes brancos e azuis, darien est\u00e1 impaciente e quer ver orion.  </p> <p>Orion est\u00e1 com vanessa, viajando atr\u00e1s de cr\u00e2nio negro, ela sente que est\u00e3o sendo seguidos, e um grupo de sckarshantallas ataca. Eles matam o grupo e deitam juntos, mas com ressentimento e com nega\u00e7\u00e3o de ser algo al\u00e9m de sexo.</p> <p>Yadallina vai a Valkaria em busca da academia arcana. L\u00e1 se encontra com Talude, o arquimago, que faz experimentos nela mas n\u00e3o descobre nada al\u00e9m de que tem alguma coisa dentro dela al\u00e9m do seu corpo e da sua alma.</p> <p>Orion e Vanessa est\u00e3o em Portsmouth e acham um cassino chamado Casa de Nimb, nos por\u00f5es h\u00e1 uma esp\u00e9cie de manic\u00f4mio e uma arena ilegal de gladiadores arcanos, l\u00e1 a dona do lugar entrega uma carta do cavaleiro risonho para orion.</p> <p>Ingram acorda em Bielefeld e se irrita consigo mesmo ao perceber que se dirigia a Norm, atr\u00e1s de Orion. Decide ir para Wynnla, o reino da magia. L\u00e1 ele para em um bordel de luxo e pede para uma S\u00facubo abrir um portal para Tenebra, o reino da deusa das trevas, e l\u00e1 ele vai, a procura de Nadia.</p> <p>Rei imperador Thormy \u00e9 atolado de pedidos de varios reinos para aceitar ajuda de yuden em assuntos militares, ele aceita sem chance de negar. Edauros e yadallina esperam por dias a oportunidade de falar com o imperador, tendo vectorius como porta voz.</p> <p>Orion e vanessa encontram o cavaleiro sorridente, ele diz que entregou vallen para cranio negro porque odeia orion, e \u00e9 um \ud83e\udd2c #$%!&amp; , o contr\u00e1rio do que orion esperava de seu pai. Ele revela que \u00e9 pai de vallen aslond. Assim orion e vanessa v\u00e3o atras de CN. Eles encontram um oraculo e servo da deusa menor da inspiracao, que luta com orion para ensin\u00e1-lo aquilo que foi esquecido.  </p> <p>Yadallina reune mais e mais drag\u00f5es a sua volta, agora com os verdes vindo prestar servitude. Eles brigam entre si e ela como uma deidade e rainha comanda que parem, curando os de suas feridas e punindo-os para se entenderem melhor. Ingram viaja por Tenebra e encontra a deusa, pede por nadia de volta e aceita uma miss\u00e3o para recuperar a espada de Rhunman, forjar ela um pouco em tenebra e devolver aos anoes de doherimm</p> <p>Darien evita o culto a tormenta em roschfallen, orion e vanessa descobrem mais sobre a tormenta com a deusa do conhecimento e o dragao da tormenta ataca o reino dos minotauros, tapista. Enquanto isso os ardilosos dragoes negros se reunem para discutir quem apoiar\u00e3o. Orion e Vanessa juntam deuses menores pra sua causa de lutar contra tormenta. Yadallina luta com os dragoes contra o dragao da tormenta, os negros se juntam com a tormenta</p> <p>Yadallina e vectorius v\u00e3o at\u00e9 Sckharshantallas lutar contra o dragso da tormenta, e usando o dragao rei sckhar eles finalmente conseguem destruir o dragao, soltando vectoria em cima dele.  </p> <p>Orion convence mais e mais deuses, agora est\u00e1 montando Hippion e brandindo uma espada deidade. Ao voltar para o seu exercito depois de adquirir a espada se d\u00e1 com um homem curvado e maltrapilho, Tillian, um dos respons\u00e1veis pela revolta dos tr\u00eas, e a deusa das av\u00f3s lhe d\u00e1 duas bolotas, memoria e sanidade.</p> <p>Todo o reino se reune para discutir os proximos passos, mitkov e yuden planejavam usurpar o reino do imperador thormy, mas mitkov n\u00e3o esperava um desafio de combate n\u00e3o armado por parte de thormy, que lhe da uma surra e o bane de l\u00e1, fazendo todos yudenianos se curvarem \u00e0 shivara, a rainha de yuden.</p> <p>Orion se encontrou com ingram e darien, descobriram as mentiras de edauros e baniram ele. Yadallina ficou com orion e os deuses e vanessa foi at\u00e9 a forja dos diabretes recuperar os equipamentos feitos com as virtudes de vallen allond</p> <p>O embate entre a tormenta e os deuses acontece em tamu-ra e tem inumeras baixas, deuses e drag\u00f5es morreram aos montes. Orion faz com que gregor perfure o ventre de yadallina enquanto ela clama por ajuda, gregor ent\u00e3o morre ao matar o deus, e de dentro da elfa sai o deus dos drag\u00f5es, que tinha sido banido por khalmyr. Vanessa e orion finalmente conseguem matar cranio negro ao usar os equipamentos de vallen allond. Rufus e ashlen entram dentro do coracao da tormenta e conseguem fech\u00e1-lo. Ingram devolve rhunman mas antes transforma ela numa espada/escopeta, honrando seu tratado com tenebra. Darien veste a armadura do cavaleiro risonho e monta bandido.</p>"},{"location":"lore/warcraft/warcraft-1/","title":"Warcraft 1","text":""},{"location":"lore/warcraft/warcraft-1/#humanos","title":"Humanos","text":""},{"location":"lore/warcraft/warcraft-1/#cronicas-da-guerra-em-azeroth","title":"Cr\u00f4nicas da Guerra em Azeroth","text":"<p>Um tratado dos eventos que levaram a guerra entre a Humanidade e as Hordas \u00d3rquicas, como relatadas por Sir Lothar, Cavaleiro do Reino.</p>"},{"location":"lore/warcraft/warcraft-1/#559","title":"559","text":"<p>Tudo estava em paz por gera\u00e7\u00f5es sob o reinado do Rei Wrynn III.

Ainda que bons l\u00edderes na guerra, esses chefes n\u00e3o tinham habilidade para colocar os escritos em palavras escritas. Eu apresento um exemplo:</p> <p>\"Thok vai por buraco brilhante. A\u00ed eu caio, mas eu bem. Eu acho muitas coisas boas para comer. N\u00f3s achamos vilarejo. N\u00f3s esmagamos eles e comemos a sua comida. Thok vai parar agora. Cabe\u00e7a d\u00f3i de escrever\"</p> <p>O fato de que sou de linhagem tanto \u00d3rquica como Humana, combinado com as habilidades e o aprendizado que adquiri das minhas jornadas, me elevou para a posi\u00e7\u00e3o que agora ocupo. Como chefe int\u00e9rprete para o Shadow Council, o dever de preservar os acontecimentos de nossa conquista deste mundo, e a eventual cruzada para a terra da Humanidade, caiu sob meus ombros. Eu, Garona, agora humildemente apresento aquela hist\u00f3ria...</p> <p>O destino da nossa ra\u00e7a j\u00e1 tinha sido previsto pelos s\u00e1bios h\u00e1 muitas eras. N\u00f3s ir\u00edamos dominar toda a terra, e assim fizemos. Nosso poder foi lentamente se alastrando, enquanto espalh\u00e1vamos sombras e dor em nosso rastro. A partir dos p\u00e2ntanos, nosso povo foi se alastrando pelas eras em todo e qualquer tipo de terreno, seja ele plan\u00edcies, florestas ou litorais rochosos. Nenhuma ra\u00e7a era p\u00e1rea para n\u00f3s. Aquelas que tentavam resistir eram liquidadas pela magia arcana de nossos Bruxos e Necromantes. Por fim, n\u00f3s dizimamos e escravizamos todos aqueles mais fracos que n\u00f3s, controlando tanto a natureza como as criaturas que nela habitavam, elevando-nos finalmente ao pin\u00e1culo desse mundo.</p> <p>E ainda assim n\u00f3s desej\u00e1vamos mais. Intrigas foram surgindo e cl\u00e3s foram sendo criados, sempre em busca de mais territ\u00f3rios, tentando saciar a sede por sangue, guerras e conquistas. Os \u00fanicos que n\u00e3o compartilhavam dessa sede eram os Bruxos. Eles estavam preocupados de que a constante batalha entre os Orcs fosse resultar no fim da nossa esp\u00e9cie, assim rompendo com o equil\u00edbrio entre as for\u00e7as necess\u00e1rias para realizar suas m\u00e1gikas. E assim decidiram que, para manter esse equil\u00edbrio, as hordas \u00f3rquicas precisariam ser fornecidas com novas batalhas contra um inimigo comum.</p> <p>Foi durante esse per\u00edodo que os seus estudos se depararam com um pequeno rasgo dimensional. Eles imaginaram que poderiam abrir uma esp\u00e9cie de portal para outros dom\u00ednios, e assim passaram eras estudando e experimentando com ele. At\u00e9 que enfim conseguiram expandir o rasgo at\u00e9 que um dos seus pudesse passar para o outro lado.</p> <p>As hist\u00f3rias que o seu colega trouxe do outro lado quase foram suficientes para convencer os bruxos de que o portal tinha o deixado louco, por\u00e9m as estranhas plantas que ele trouxe de l\u00e1 confirmaram o seu relato. Com isso eles se reuniram com os chefes dos cl\u00e3s para pedir uma tr\u00e9gua das guerras por um ano, onde no fim desse per\u00edodo eles teriam novas terras para desbravar e conquistar.</p> <p>Quanto maior o portal ficava, mais f\u00e1cil era control\u00e1-lo, e em quest\u00e3o de tr\u00eas luas um pequeno batalh\u00e3o de tropas foi convocado para realizar a travessia. Ap\u00f3s se submeterem a um arco-\u00edris de explos\u00f5es de luz arcana, o que os recebeu do outro lado foram plan\u00edcies cinzentas que lentamente foram sendo agraciadas pelo calor laranja do Sol. Os guerreiros se depararam com constru\u00e7\u00f5es pontudas de pedra, caminhos de ch\u00e3o batido e pequenas criaturas rosadas e carentes de m\u00fasculos, um banquete f\u00e1cil para a tropa.</p> <p>A tropa ent\u00e3o investiu contra o vilarejo, massacrando todos que se encontravam no seu caminho. Os machos demonstraram uma leve resist\u00eancia, por\u00e9m as f\u00eameas e os filhotes foram mais f\u00e1ceis do que levar um grok para o abate. N\u00e3o havia muitos esp\u00f3lios interessantes, por\u00e9m as planta\u00e7\u00f5es eram de um gr\u00e3o gostoso, e o escasso gado tamb\u00e9m tinha se provado excelente. A manufatura humana era estranha para o povo \u00f3rquico, e por isso foi imediatamente confiscada pelos chefes dos cl\u00e3s, que ficaram ansiosos com a explora\u00e7\u00e3o dessa fr\u00e1gil terra que se tornaria mais uma gema na coroa do dom\u00ednio \u00f3rquico.</p> <p>No in\u00edcio fomos cautelosos e exploramos a nova terra em busca de informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre os seus habitantes, e descobrimos que os seres que l\u00e1 habitavam eram como n\u00f3s em diversos aspectos. Uma paulada na cabe\u00e7a leva \u00e0 morte, assim como a fome, e a dor resulta em rea\u00e7\u00f5es parecidas com todos os nossos antigos inimigos, algo \u00fatil para extrair informa\u00e7\u00f5es.</p> <p>Descobrimos ent\u00e3o que essa terra se chama Azeroth, e que o povo se autodenominava como Humanos. Assim fomos explorando at\u00e9 que a gan\u00e2ncia dos chefes falou mais alto, e ficou decidido que um assalto \u00e0 grande fortaleza do norte resultaria no fim dos Humanos e na ascens\u00e3o dos Orcs ao poder. Com isso mais e mais tropas foram sendo enviadas para o novo mundo, e com elas parecia que um pouco da nossa terra os acompanhava. Os bruxos disseram que era algum fen\u00f4meno ligado ao portal, mas o fato \u00e9 de que logo todo o nosso entorno se tornou t\u00e3o desolado como a nossa terra natal.</p> <p>A entrada no castelo se mostrou algo simples, pois o que fez essa terra pr\u00f3spera e atrativa para o nosso povo tamb\u00e9m fez dos seus habitantes seres fr\u00e1geis. Avan\u00e7amos e destru\u00edmos com pouca resist\u00eancia, e a vit\u00f3ria se mostrava certa at\u00e9 a chegada dos grandes soldados montados. Esses seres musculosos montavam bestas enormes que devastaram nossas tropas, reunindo seus companheiros para nos expulsar das fortifica\u00e7\u00f5es, e consequentemente nos fazendo recuar para o portal que levava a nossa dimens\u00e3o.</p> <p>Cerca de quinze anos se passaram desde que essa cr\u00edtica decis\u00e3o alterou o rumo do nosso destino. Muitos argumentaram pelo fechamento do portal, enquanto outros lutavam para convenc\u00ea-los de que poder\u00edamos vencer com outra investida contra os Humanos, se reun\u00edssemos todo o nosso poderio. No meio dessa discuss\u00e3o um Orc se destacou pela sua acuidade e esperteza, e aos poucos o seu poder pol\u00edtico cresceu a ponto de ningu\u00e9m mais conseguir se op\u00f4r aos seus planos. Ap\u00f3s oponentes chave serem silenciados e negocia\u00e7\u00f5es serem cautelosamente manipuladas, o reinado do grande Orc Chefe Guerreiro Blackhand estava sobre o nosso povo.</p> <p>Sua crueldade e domin\u00e2ncia em batalha s\u00e3o apenas ofuscadas pela sua sede de poder. Ao estudar os modos com que os ex\u00e9rcitos Humanos conseguiram derrotar os n\u00fameros superiores dos Orcs a partir de estrat\u00e9gia, ele aprendeu a trazer organiza\u00e7\u00e3o para as nossas pilhagens. Buscando aux\u00edlio de ambas as casas das artes arcanas, ele conseguiu unir todos os cl\u00e3s \u00f3rquicos - os Ex\u00e9rcitos, os Bruxos e os Necromantes. Para assim trazer a eventual destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da ra\u00e7a Humana.

The goal here is to reduce the source data rate. The ratio between the source data rate and the channel data rate is called the compression factor, or coding gain.

It was basically designed to allow moving pictures and sound to be encoded into the bit rate of an audio Compact Disc. In order to meet the low bit requirement, MPEG-1 downsampled the images heavily as well as using picture rates of only 24-30 Hz, and the resulting quality was moderate. MPEG-2 was considerably broader in scope and of wider appeal. It was chosen as the compression scheme for both DVB (digital video broadcasting) and DVD (digital video disk). The goals of MPEG-3 were ready by the time MPEG-2 was standardized, so it was incorporated into it. MPEG-4 uses further coding tools with additional complexity to achieve higher compression factors than MPEG-2. It can also code computer graphics applications. The MPEG-4 decoder effectively becomes a rendering processor, and the compressed bitstream describes three-dimensional shapes and surface texture.

Different studies have been conducted to better understand how these models were trained and on what data, and how they could be improved and generalized by prompt engineering. Here we explored the impact of data and model scaling for zero-shot gender classification using openCLIP, and how to employ simple prompt tuning methods to improve these results. We perceived a 2% improvement in accuracy with the scaling of models, and yet we could not see the same behavior when scaling data-sources. For all models, the original OpenAI's WIT dataset achieved the highest accuracy, even though its 30 times smaller than the biggest CommonPool dataset, composed of 12.3 billion samples. We followed by exploring textual prompt ensembling and similarity aggregation techniques that were able to improve baseline results while retaining general accuracy and reducing contextual bias.</p>"},{"location":"science/CLIP/SIBGRAPI-2024/sections/bias-related-work/","title":"Related Work: Bias","text":""},{"location":"science/CLIP/SIBGRAPI-2024/sections/bias-related-work/#topics","title":"Topics","text":"<ul> <li>Describe existing bias</li> <li>Describe gender classification bias</li> <li>Talk about gender classification papers</li> </ul> <p>Following the initial experiments performed by the CLIP authors in Section 7.1 Bias, several works have focused on exploring social biases present in vision language models. These initial experiments detected racial and gender biases in image classification tasks when prompting CLIP with human and non-human labels, and gender-agnostic profession labels.</p> <p>in \\cite{gender_disparities} the authors explore gender bias in vision language models by probing CLIP and two other models built upon it, Detic \\cite{cetic} for bounding box detection and LSeg \\cite{lseg} for semantic segmentation. To compare the performance of the models in image classification, object detection and segmentation, they used the Visual Genome dataset \\cite{visual_genome}, where each image contain bounding boxes for persons and gender-neutral objects like bag, necklace and sweater. All models performed better for images containing women for these three objects, while performing better for images containing men for objects like necktie, wheel and hat. They also point that a common practice of reporting the mean average precision across all concepts as a single, summary statistic of model performance can potentially mask the disparities between them, and lend a false assurance of model consistency across demographic groups (unbiased). To explore the impact of the dataset in the studied tasks, they employed both the Visual Genome and the COCO \\cite{coco_dataset} datasets. In a range of concepts they showed that the bias is present in both of them, therefore it is not dataset specific. Furthermore, They found that the bias in word embeddings parallel the biases in the zero-shot vision-language models, and as such verifies the claims that biases from language models are passed to vision models learnt from it.</p> <p>According to \\cite{fairer_clip}, model bias can be classified based on the dependencies between the data attributes. Such attributes can be dependent or independent from each other. Correlations between dependent attributes, such as high cheekbone and sex, are called an intrinsic dependence, while the correlation between independent attributes, such as hair color and sex, are called a spurious correlation. The authors claim that debiasing methods are commonly focused on the spurious correlations, requiring or not ground-truth labels and use iterative methods computationally costly. Their method is supposed to address all these issues. They developed a method to learn the biases from text and image embeddings of CLIP and deploy their model as a post-processing stage after CLIP encoding and prior to cosine similarity classifiers.</p> <p>The authors of \\cite{biased_prompts} propose a calibration loss that minimizes the discrepancy between a pair of prompt embeddings that contain biases. By doing so, the embeddings of both male and female versions of a given prompt should be similar, and as such, debiased. Only focusing on the text embedding was sufficient to improve group robustness of zero-shot models, corroborating the claims of parallelism between VLMs and LLMs biases.</p> <p>The ease of use and feasibility of such models could improve the work of those that lack the technical knowledge or the resources to build, deploy and use vision models in their activities. However, the unaware use of these tools with bad class design could be dangerous, specially for those oppressed demographic groups.</p> <p>From these works we can better understand the impact and the presence of biased points of view regarding gender in our society, captured by these large models trained unconstrained from data scraped from every corner of the web. While this is not a definitive solution, it is of the utmost importance to mitigate these kind of bias from \"real world\" applications that rely on the judgment of these models for its decision making.</p>"},{"location":"science/CLIP/SIBGRAPI-2024/sections/introduction/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"science/CLIP/SIBGRAPI-2024/sections/introduction/#topics","title":"Topics","text":"<ul> <li>About VLMs: How they work, what are good, about zero-shot and its problems</li> <li>About Bias Related Works: What did they discover about bias, how they tackle it</li> <li>About Gender Classification Related Works: What they evaluate and how.

These initial experiments detected racial and gender biases in image classification tasks when prompting CLIP with human and non-human labels, and gender-agnostic profession labels.</p> <p>in \\cite{gender_disparities} the authors explore gender bias in vision language models by probing CLIP and two other models built upon it, Detic \\cite{detic} for bounding box detection and LSeg \\cite{lseg} for semantic segmentation. To compare the performance of the models in image classification, object detection and segmentation, they used the Visual Genome dataset \\cite{visual_genome}, where each image contain bounding boxes for persons and gender-neutral objects like bag, necklace and sweater. All models performed better for images containing women for these three objects, while performing better for images containing men for objects like necktie, wheel and hat. They also point that a common practice of reporting the mean average precision across all concepts as a single, summary statistic of model performance can potentially mask the disparities between them, and lend a false assurance of model consistency across demographic groups (unbiased). To explore the impact of the dataset in the studied tasks, they employed both the Visual Genome and the COCO \\cite{coco} datasets. In a range of concepts they showed that the bias is present in both of them, therefore it is not dataset specific. Furthermore, They found that the bias in word embeddings parallel the biases in the zero-shot vision-language models, and as such verifies the claims that biases from language models are passed to vision models learnt from it.</p> <p>According to \\cite{fairer_clip}, model bias can be classified based on the dependencies between the data attributes. Such attributes can be dependent or independent from each other. Correlations between dependent attributes, such as high cheekbone and sex, are called an intrinsic dependence, while the correlation between independent attributes, such as hair color and sex, are called a spurious correlation. The authors claim that debiasing methods are commonly focused on the spurious correlations, requiring or not ground-truth labels and use iterative methods computationally costly. Their method is supposed to address all these issues. They developed a method to learn the biases from text and image embeddings of CLIP and deploy their model as a post-processing stage after CLIP encoding and prior to cosine similarity classifiers.</p> <p>The authors of \\cite{biased_prompts} propose a calibration loss that minimizes the discrepancy between a pair of prompt embeddings that contain biases. By doing so, the embeddings of both male and female versions of a given prompt should be similar, and as such, debiased.

As for model scaling, in the smaller datasets the increase in model size also increased all genders and races being classified as criminal, except for the images of white women.

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, or CLIP, is a VLM based on contrastive learning, a strategy that leverages pairs of positive and negative examples to learn how to predict similarities between positive pairs, and differences between the negative ones.</p> <p>CLIP is based on a cross-entropy loss function called InfoNCE, in which the goal is to learn how to calculate a distance metric, such as cosine similarity, to predict the most likely pair of examples that is closest to the real distribution, while distancing all negative examples from it [5]. In CLIP, positive pairs are defined as one image and its corresponding ground truth caption while the negative examples are defined as the same image but with all the other possible captions. It then trains a vision and a text encoder to map the representation of an input image and a given textual label to similar embedding vectors using a contrastive loss [4]. See Figure REF for a summary of the CLIP approach.</p> <p></p> <p>CLIP models were trained in a dataset containing 400 million image-text pairs, and come in two available architectures, one based in the original ResNet-50 [6] and the other based on Vision Transformer (ViT) [7]. ResNets leverage residual learning to address the degradation problem of deep neural networks by letting the stacked layers fit a residual mapping instead of the original, unreferenced one. Formally, by denoting the underlying mapping as H(x), the authors let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of F(x) := H(x) - x. The original mapping is recast into F(x) + x [6]. This is better described in Figure REF.</p> <p></p> <p>ResNets were the state-of-the-art in machine translation (the automatic translation of written text from one natural language to another [8]) but they are highly sequential and suffer from long sentences [9]. The idea of Transformers is to ditch recurrence and convolutions, instead relying entirely on attention mechanisms to map the relationships between input and output sequences.</p> <p>Vision Transformers applies the standard Transformer architecture directly to images by splitting it into patches and providing the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to the model. By doing so, image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. When trained on mid-sized datasets, their performance is sub-optimal, due to a lack of inductive biases inherent to CNNs, such as translation equivariance and locality. However, when trained on larger datasets (14M-300M images), they were able to trump inductive bias and achieve performances comparable or better than the current state of the art [7]. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of tokens embeddings. To handle 2D images, the image is reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches, that are flattened and mapped to the transformer dimensions with a trainable linear projection. A class token is prepended to the sequence of embeddings, this is a learnable embedding whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the representation of image features. Along with each patch embedding is a standard learnable 1D position embedding to retain positional information.

Now, for a variety of different recognition tasks, the most accurate models are adapted by fully fine-tuning the pre-trained foundation models such as CLIP [10].

Prompt tuning is the idea that the prompt can be treated as a task-specific learnable feature, in order to correctly \"ask a question\" to a language model [13].</p>"},{"location":"science/CLIP/dissertacao/background/#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li>Can soft biometric traits assist user recognition? 2004 Jain et al.</li> <li>Attribute and simile classifiers for face verification. 2009 Kumar et al.</li> <li>Intelligent deep learning based ethnicity recognition and classification using facial images</li> <li>Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision (CLIP).

This often requires domain expertise and time to do it correctly. The authors of [14] propose a method to learn the better prompt used in such tasks. They called it Context Optimization (CoOp), a simple approach specifically adapting CLIP-like vision-language models. <p>CoOp models a prompt's context words with learnable vectors while the entire pre-trained parameters are kept fixed.

Unified context is better to classes that share a common context, while class-specific context will learn a specific set of context tokens for each class, more suitable for fine-grained categories.</p> <p>In CoOp, the prompt is designed as a sequence of learnable vectors, followed by a target class.

The goal is to learn the best combination of such vectors in order to predict the correct class name.</p> <p>This class token can be placed at the end of the sequence, or in the middle.

Hence, they can be used out-of-the-box, avoiding the massive amounts of processing power required to prepare the data, train the model, and fine-tune it. Specifically for zero-shot image classification tasks, the only step required is the proper class design, which must reflect the target classification labels and compose the text prompt. For example, a two-class problem involving cats and dogs can be seen as the process of encoding an image of such pets and comparing it with the encoding of a set of different text-prompts, such as ``a photo of a dog'' and ''a photo of a cat''. The contrastive-learning nature of these models will provide us with the ability to compute the cosine similarity between these images and the text-prompts to extract the final classification label.</p> <p>To further explore the capabilities of CLIP in zero-shot tasks, the authors of openCLIP\\cite{open_clip} trained several ViT models with different patch sizes and number of trainable parameters on a variety of open-source datasets, like Laion-400M \\cite{laion400}, Laion-5B \\cite{laion}, DataComp-1B and its unfiltered version with 12.8B image-text pairs called CommonPool \\cite{datacomp}. They observed the scaling behavior of CLIP models as a function of training set size, model size and compute. Beyond their findings, they also released more than 120 model checkpoints, trained on different dataset combinations, in their public repository \\cite{open_clip_repo}. Gadre et al.~\\cite{datacomp} showed that scaling is important, but the quality of the dataset also plays an important role. In fact, their results indicated that using a ``good'' subset of massive datasets can yield better results than training using all data.</p> <p>In \\cite{learn_name_classes} the authors draw attention to the fact that VLMs suffer from high sensitivity to class-prompt textual content and from the complexity to adapt to new, unseen data. They propose to leverage the concept of textual inversion \\cite{textual_inversion} to adapt models to new data and thus address suboptimal, and potentially wrong, labels. To do so they describe categories of interest by applying available data to learn optimal word embeddings, as a function fo the visual content.</p> <p>In the work of \\cite{tai-dpt} the contrastive-learning nature of image and text encoders found in VLMs is explored to treat texts as images for prompt tuning, alleviating the need of visual data to learn prompts and reducing the impact of data-limited and label-limited settings.</p> <p>The authors of \\cite{robustification} observe how language models contain actionable insights that can be exploited to improve themselves or other models, and showed how it is possible to improve model's zero-shot performance without labeled data, training or fine-tuning or manual identification.</p> <p>According to AlDahoul et al. [1] the direct applications of VLMs in facial attribute recognition are still unexplored. As such, they developped a multi-task classifier that leverages the capabilities of VLMs to simultaneously identify multiple human facial attributes, specifically race, gender, age and emotion. They explored commercially available Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT [2], GEMINI [3], LLAVA [4], PaliGemma [5] and Florence2 [6] to classify facial attributes using various datasets, such as FairFace, AffectNet [7], and UTKFace [8]. The facial recognition application was formulated as a visual question-answer task, see Figure REF for more detail.

Age groups were also combined into 5 categories: 0-9, 10-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60+. GPT-4o achieved highest accuracy 77.4%.

These initial experiments detected racial and gender biases in image classification tasks when prompting CLIP with human and non-human labels, and gender-agnostic profession labels.</p> <p>According to \\cite{fairer_clip}, model bias can be classified based on the dependencies between the data attributes. Such attributes can be dependent or independent from each other. Correlations between dependent attributes, such as high cheekbone and sex, are called an intrinsic dependence, while the correlation between independent attributes, such as hair color and sex, are called a spurious correlation. The authors claim that debiasing methods are commonly focused on the spurious correlations, requiring or not ground-truth labels and use iterative methods computationally costly. Their method is supposed to address all these issues. They developed a method to learn the biases from text and image embeddings of CLIP and deploy their model as a post-processing stage after CLIP encoding and prior to cosine similarity classifiers.</p> <p>The authors of \\cite{biased_prompts} propose a calibration loss that minimizes the discrepancy between a pair of prompt embeddings that contain biases. By doing so, the embeddings of both male and female versions of a given prompt should be similar, and as such, debiased. Only focusing on the text embedding was sufficient to improve group robustness of zero-shot models, corroborating the claims of parallelism between VLMs and LLMs biases.</p> <p>Leveraging this findings, The work of \\citeonline{dark_side} explored the effect of dataset scaling in racial classification. They used openCLIP's models and Chicago Face Dataset (CFD) to probe the model in experiments similar to those performed by openAI, where they classify the images in human (criminal, thief) and non-human (gorilla) classes to discover social biases.</p> <p>The observations made were that dataset scaling increased the number of Latino and Black faces being labeled with criminal classes on the larger models, while smaller models reduced this behavior as training size increased. As for model scaling, in the smaller datasets the increase in model size also increased all genders and races being classified as criminal, except for the images of white women. However in the larger datasets increasing model size have increased all men classes being labeled as criminals. Furthermore, they corroborated the fact that the social biases present in multi-modal settings are parallel to those present in textual embeddings.</p> <p>The ease of use and feasibility of such models could improve the work of those that lack the technical knowledge or the resources to build, deploy and use vision models in their activities. However, the unaware use of these tools with bad class design could be dangerous, specially for those oppressed demographic groups.</p> <p>Based on these findings, our work aims to further explore the impact of model and data scaling of CLIP models for the zero-shot race recognition task, while also observing the power of prompt tuning and ensemble in improving classification and fairness (TODO) measures.</p>"},{"location":"science/CLIP/dissertacao/results/","title":"Results","text":""},{"location":"science/CLIP/dissertacao/results/#data-scaling","title":"Data scaling","text":"<p>datacomp and commonpool had really poor results model wise, this could be due to the fact that these datasets were tailored for specific downstream tasks, and didn\u00b4t generalized well for off scope scenarios, such as race prediction.</p> <p>General accuracy was not consistent with scaling of dataset sizes.

Para os r\u00f3tulos de g\u00eanero est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel apenas os conceitos bin\u00e1rios, Male e Female. Para idade, diversos intervalos est\u00e3o presentes, desde 0-2 anos at\u00e9 mais de 70. As imagens possuem uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o fixa de 224 x 224 pixels, com duas op\u00e7\u00f5es de margem de corte, 0.25 e 1.25.</p> <p>Esse prompt padr\u00e3o pode ser definido como a vers\u00e3o ``pronta para uso'' que um usu\u00e1rio final poderia implantar imediatamente. A partir disso n\u00f3s conduzimos nosso benchmark de escalonamento, ao expandirmos a arquitetura dos modelos e o tamanho dos conjuntos de treinamento, aproveitando o reposit\u00f3rio recentemente disponibilizado do OpenCLIP \\cite{open_clip_repo}.</p> <p>Ainda que haja melhorias nestes escalonamentos, resultados ainda est\u00e3o insuficientes para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es reais, ent\u00e3o n\u00f3s propomos um experimento de engenharia de prompt, onde melhoramos o prompt padr\u00e3o de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens com informa\u00e7\u00f5es mais contextualizadas, na forma de adjetivos biom\u00e9tricos relacionados a idade, ra\u00e7a e g\u00eanero. Finalizamos os experimentos ao treinar um modelo de prompt tuning chamado CoOp \\cite{coop} para aprender os melhores prompts para a tarefa de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de etnia.</p> <p>A ideia principal do CLIP \u00e9 utilizar um par de encoders de imagem e texto treinados para gerarem vetores de caracter\u00edsticas alinhados, e existem diversas escolhas de encoders e conjuntos de treinamento, impactando fortemente nos resultados finais. Ainda que existam encoders convolucionais de imagens, os melhores resultados foram encontrados com os Vision Transformers, ou ViTs. Diferentes ViTs com um crescente n\u00famero de par\u00e2metros foram testados em \\cite{clip}, como ViT-B (base) e ViT-L (large). Modelos ainda maiores como ViT-H (huge) e ViT-g (giant) foram treinados em \\cite{open_clip}. Neste trabalho, consideramos todas essas variantes.</p> <p>Para cada uma destas arquiteturas, h\u00e1 a op\u00e7\u00e3o de variados conjuntos de dados de treinamento, convencionalmente chamados aqui de \\textit{fontes de dados}, contendo pares de imagens e seus correspondentes descritores textuais. O artigo original do CLIP \\cite{clip} descreve brevemente o seu processo de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de dados utilizado para criar o seu conjunto de dados privado chamado WebImageText (WIT-400M), que cont\u00e9m 400 milh\u00f5es de pares de imagem/texto coletados da Internet. Al\u00e9m dele, tamb\u00e9m existem uma r\u00e9plica de c\u00f3digo aberto chamado LAION-400M \\cite{laion400}, que cont\u00e9m 400 milh\u00f5es de pares de imagem e texto coletados do reposit\u00f3rio aberto Common Crawl \\cite{common_crawl}, filtrados usando modelos CLIP para similaridade de imagem e texto. Baseado nesse esfor\u00e7o inicial, uma vers\u00e3o maior desse dataset foi constru\u00edda, consistindo em 5.85 bilh\u00f5es de pares de imagem e texto, filtradas utilizando o CLIP, sendo que 2.32B est\u00e3o na l\u00edngua inglesa. Tanto sua vers\u00e3o 400M como a de 2B est\u00e3o sendo utilizadas no OpenCLIP \\cite{open_clip} e s\u00e3o adotadas neste trabalho.</p> <p>O prompt escolhido inicialmente como base foi o padr\u00e3o para classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de imagens, o <code>a photo of a ...''. No nosso caso, esse prompt foi adaptado para</code>a photo of a '' para classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00eanero, e ``a photo of a  person'' para a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de etnia. Esse prompt base \u00e9 suficiente para diversas tarefas, mas n\u00f3s argumentamos que ao lapidarmos estes prompts para melhor contextualizar as classes alvo n\u00f3s podemos melhorar os resultados da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Ao expandirmos esses prompts originais com mais atributos faciais, n\u00f3s criamos manualmente alguns prompts com uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de r\u00f3tulos de idade, ra\u00e7a e g\u00eanero. <p>O princ\u00edpio da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o zero-shot com modelos pr\u00e9 treinados \u00e9 encontrar o melhor alinhamento entre um conjunto de prompts de texto e uma imagem de entrada. J\u00e1 que os conjuntos de treinamento s\u00e3o massivos e na sua maioria coletados da web, \u00e9 quase imposs\u00edvel \\textit{adivinhar} qual descritor textual foi usado para uma certa imagem. N\u00f3s hipotetizamos que prompts textuais mais completos, incluindo adjetivos relacionados \u00e0 biometria, podem melhorar os resultados da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o zero-shot. Mais precisamente, n\u00f3s exploramos templates de prompts que incluem informa\u00e7\u00e3o biom\u00e9trica, ao combinarmos uma lista de palavras referentes a idade, ra\u00e7a e g\u00eanero. O prompt foi constru\u00eddo utilizando o prefixo mencionado anteriormente e uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de ra\u00e7a + g\u00eanero, e idade + ra\u00e7a + g\u00eanero. Tamb\u00e9m adicionamos os prompts originais que possuem apenas o g\u00eanero e a ra\u00e7a. A lista de termos para cada atributo \u00e9 apresentado abaixo.</p> <p>\\begin{minted}{python} age_list    = ['young', 'old', 'middle-aged'] race_list   = ['black', 'white', 'latino hispanic',                'indian', 'east asian', 'southeast asian',                'middle eastern'] gender_list = ['woman', 'man'] \\end{minted}</p> <p>Come\u00e7amos nossos experimentos com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de g\u00eanero, e para isso formulamos um prompt base chamado GP: \\texttt{A photo of a man} e \\texttt{A photo of a woman}. A partir disso, criamos um outro grupo de prompts com a adi\u00e7\u00e3o das etnias, chamado RGP, com, por exemplo, o prompt \\texttt{A photo of a black woman}. Finalmente, unimos todos os r\u00f3tulos descritivos poss\u00edveis ao adicionarmos adjetivos de idade na mistura, formando um novo grupo de prompts chamados ARGP. Um exemplo de prompt desse grupo \u00e9 \\texttt{A photo of an old black woman}. </p> <p>N\u00f3s conseguimos observar uma melhoria consistente em quase todas as m\u00e9tricas com o escalonamento dos modelos, corroborando as leis de escalonamento apresentados em \\citeonline{open_clip}. ViT-H-14 apresentou a melhor acur\u00e1cia, enquanto ViT-g-14 obteve a menor pontua\u00e7\u00e3o GDif, nossa m\u00e9trica customizada que mede a dist\u00e2ncia entre a acur\u00e1cia da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos r\u00f3tulos Male e Female, onde quanto mais pr\u00f3ximo de zero, menos enviesado o modelo apresenta ser. Valores negativos de GDif foram observados em quase todos os modelos, indicando uma acur\u00e1cia maior para o g\u00eanero feminino.</p> <p>Nos subgrupos das etnias n\u00f3s observamos que a classe Black obteve a menor acur\u00e1cia, enquanto Middle Eastern obteve a maior. Ao explorarmos as imagens da etnia negra que o modelo classificou o g\u00eanero de forma errada, percebemos que mais da metade deles (65\\%) pertenciam aos grupos et\u00e1rios mais jovens, dentre 0 e 19 anos. Isso era esperado j\u00e1 que tra\u00e7os normativos de cada g\u00eanero ainda est\u00e3o indefinidos. Dentre esses exemplares haviam 14 imagens de baixa qualidade, e 18 imagens onde contiam mais de uma face presente, potencialmente confundindo o modelo.</p> <p>Por outro lado, o subgrupo Middle Eastern obteve os melhores resultados, provavelmente devido a uma maior presen\u00e7a de p\u00ealos faciais nos homens, e o uso de aparatos espec\u00edficos de g\u00eanero como a burka nas mulheres.</p> <p>Estas melhorias n\u00e3o foram observadas no escalonamento dos dados, onde o dataset original da OpenAI, o WIT, obteve um desempenho melhor do que as outras fontes de dados mesmo sendo um dos menores conjuntos dispon\u00edveis, demonstrando que a performance dos modelos n\u00e3o pode ser melhorada apenas com mais volumes de dados. N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel examinar de forma aprofundada a raz\u00e3o destes resultados por conta da natureza privada do dataset; podemos apenas imaginar que t\u00e9cnicas de coleta e filtragem complexas foram utilizadas para otimizar os modelos.</p> <p>Depois destes testes iniciais, expandimos nossos experimentos para avaliarmos o reconhecimento de etnia, utilizando os r\u00f3tulos de ``ra\u00e7a'' dispon\u00edveis no conjunto de dados FairFace. Existem sete classes diferentes para esse atributo: White, Black, Latino_Hispanic, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Indian, e Middle Eastern. Baseado nesses r\u00f3tulos, n\u00f3s criamos o prompt base para etnias (RP) com o seguinte template: \\texttt{A photo of a  person}. A partir disso n\u00f3s adicionamos g\u00eanero e idade, assim como fizemos com os prompts de g\u00eaneros apresentados anteriormente. <p>Ainda que o escalonamento dos modelos e dos dados tenha melhorado os resultados da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de etnias, os valores ainda est\u00e3o muito abaixo daqueles observados nos resultados para g\u00eanero, sugerindo que o reconhecimento de etnia \u00e9 uma tarefa muito mais complexa. Por isso decidimos explorar os efeitos dos adjetivos auxiliares presentes nos nossos prompts RGP e ARGP.</p> <p>Para os modelos menores, especialmente para o ViT-B-16 e o ViT-L-14, observamos uma melhora significativa na acur\u00e1cia, indo de 0.5886 e 0.5922 respectivamente utilizando os prompts RP originais, para 0.6558 e 0.6724 utilizando os prompts ARGP propostos.</p> <p>Esta engenharia de prompts pode melhorar os resultados de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o, por\u00e9m s\u00e3o uma tarefa manual e normalmente laboriosa. Com isso, n\u00f3s tamb\u00e9m exploramos a automatiza\u00e7\u00e3o da elabora\u00e7\u00e3o dos prompts ao adotarmos um algoritmo de prompt tuning chamado CoOp. Em modelos de vis\u00e3o e linguagem, aprendizado de prompts refere-se a uma t\u00e9cnica para adaptar modelos transformers de acordo com tarefas de vis\u00e3o, ao introduzir par\u00e2metros trein\u00e1veis no encoder de texto do modelo, enquanto mant\u00e9m todo o backbone congelado. Esse novo tipo de fine-tuning demonstrou uma performance promissora enquanto utiliza menos de 1\\% dos par\u00e2metros dos modelos \\cite{jia2022visual}.</p> <p>Seguindo a linha de trabalho sobre o impacto do prompt textual na classifica\u00e7\u00e3o zero-shot de atributos faciais, n\u00f3s treinamos diversos modelos CoOp para verificarmos essas afirma\u00e7\u00f5es. Modelos CoOp aprendem qual \u00e9 o template ideal para uma certa tarefa de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o, ao introduzir na entrada de texto vetores de tokens optimiz\u00e1veis chamados de vetores de contexto, ajustando-os a partir de uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o de custo. Nem sempre estes tokens s\u00e3o leg\u00edveis, mas eles s\u00e3o a mais pr\u00f3xima aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o da dist\u00e2ncia contrastiva para um determinado r\u00f3tulo alvo.</p> <p>Estes prompts optimizados foram capazes de ultrapassar os nossos prompts manuais em 7 pontos, provando que os melhores prompts para uma determinada tarefa nem sempre s\u00e3o l\u00f3gicos ou est\u00e3o sujeitos \u00e0 melhorias manuais.</p> <p>\\chapter{Conclus\u00e3o}</p> <p>Reconhecimento de g\u00eanero e etnia s\u00e3o uma parte vital em sistemas de reconhecimento automatizado de atributos faciais, com aplica\u00e7\u00f5es reais em vigil\u00e2ncia, seguran\u00e7a e estudos demogr\u00e1ficos. Por\u00e9m, a ado\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos de vis\u00e3o e linguagem nestas tarefas continuam inexploradas. Com esse fim, n\u00f3s conduzimos um benchmark de leis de escalonamento para a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o zero-shot de g\u00eanero e etnia utilizando modelos OpenCLIP \\cite{open_clip} no popular conjunto de dados FairFace \\cite{fair_face}. Nossos resultados indicaram que o escalonamento puro n\u00e3o \u00e9 suficiente, especialmente para classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de etnias, com uma acur\u00e1cia mediana de 0.68 com ViT-H-14 e exibindo sinais de vi\u00e9ses de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o ao se mostrar incapaz de reconhecer corretamente o subgrupo <code>Latino Hispanic'' (0.40 de acur\u00e1cia no mesmo modelo ViT-H-14). N\u00f3s fomos capazes de melhorar a acur\u00e1cia e reduzir estes vi\u00e9ses ao manufaturarmos prompts ricos em caracter\u00edsticas, indo de 0.58 para 0.65 com ViT-B-16, e alcan\u00e7amos os limites do prompting ao utilizarmos um algoritmo de prompt tuning para aprendermos os melhores prompts para esta tarefa de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Este m\u00e9todo foi capaz de mitigar alguns problemas s\u00e9rios nos modelos base, como com o subgrupo</code>White'', melhorando a acur\u00e1cia de 0.10 para 0.81 no modelo ViT-L-14, enquanto utiliza uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o incompreens\u00edvel de palavras no seu template. Estes resultados indicam que avaliar o vi\u00e9s utilizando modelos tipo o CLIP \u00e9 uma tarefa \u00e1rdua, j\u00e1 que a escolha dos melhores prompts podem impactar consideravelmente os resultados da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o.</p> <p>N\u00f3s escolhemos explorar as capacidades reais dos modelos CLIP para as tarefas de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o zero-shot, e por conta disso n\u00f3s n\u00e3o pr\u00e9 processamos nem filtramos nenhuma das imagens do conjunto de dados FairFace. Ao fazermos isso, n\u00f3s observamos algumas limita\u00e7\u00f5es qualitativas do conjunto de dados em si, como por exemplo imagens com \u00e2ngulos ruins, qualidade baixa, ou apresentando mais de uma face. N\u00f3s esperamos expandir essa linha de trabalho ao explorarmos outros conjuntos de dados de imagens faciais, focando naqueles com auto identifica\u00e7\u00e3o das informa\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais como ra\u00e7a, g\u00eanero e idade.

Encode the number of coefficients and trailing ones (coeff_token)</p> <p>The first VLC, coeff_token, encodes both the total number of non-zero coefficients (Total-Coeffs) and the number of trailing +/- 1 values (T1). Total-Coeffs can range from 0 (no coefficients in the 4 x 4 block), to 16, i.e. 16 non-zero coefficients. T1 can take values from 0 to 3. If there are more than three trailing +/- 1s, only the last three are treated as 'special cases' and any others are coded as normal coefficients.</p> <p>2. Encode the sign of each T1</p> <p>For each trailing +/- T1 signalled by coeff_token, the sign is encoded with a single bit, 0 = +, 1 = -, in reverse order, starting with the highest-frequency T1.</p> <p>3. Encode the levels of the remaining non-zero coefficients</p> <p>The level, i.e. the sign and magnitude, of each remaining non-zero coefficient in the block is encoded in reverse order, starting with the highest frequency and working back towards the DC coefficient. The choice of VLC to encode each successive level is context adaptive and depends on the magnitude of the previous coded level.</p> <p>4. Encode the total number of zeros before the last coefficient</p> <p>TotalZeros is the sum of all zeros preceding the highest non-zero coefficient in the reordered array and is coded with a VLC. The reason for sending a separate VLC to indicate TotalZeros is that many blocks contain zero coefficients at the start of the array and, as will be seen later, this approach means that zero-runs at the start of the array need not be encoded.</p> <p>5. Encode each run of zeros</p> <p>The number of zeros preceding each non-zero coefficient (run_before) is encoded in reverse order. A run_before parameter is encoded for each non-zero coefficient, starting with the highest frequency, with two exceptions:</p> <ol> <li>If there are no more zeros left to encode</li> <li>If it is not necessary to encode run_before for the final or lowest frequency non-zero coefficient.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"science/h264-handbook/chapter-7-transform-quant-coding/#743-context-adaptive-binary-arithmetic-coding-cabac","title":"7.4.3 Context Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding, CABAC","text":"<p>CABAC is an optional entropy coding mode available in Main and High profiles.

Accidents at offshore oil drilling platforms or oil pipeline networks can provoke severe oil spills.</p> <p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mounted on aircrafts or satellites is the most common sensory equipment in marine remote sensing systems. the SAR sensor is a microwave-based technology, that emits radio wave pulses and receives their reflection in order to capture a representation of the target scene, widely known as SAR images. The sensor is considered an ideal option due to its robustness against weather and illumination changes. Oil spreading over the sea surface dampens the capillary waves, and so the backscatter radio waves are suppressed. As such, oil spills are depicted as black spots, contrary to the brighter regions which are usually related with unspoiled polluted sea areas. Also, the wide coverage of the sensor is of relevant importance, since oil spills could cover kilometers, as well as further contextual information, such as close-coastal regions or vessels, which can be enclosed in the acquired image.</p> <p>The detection can be challenging, since oceanic natural phenomena such as low wind speed regions, weed beds and algae blooms, wave shadows behind land, grease ice, etc. can also be depicted as dark spots, resulting in possible false positives look-alikes.</p> <p>Automated detection of oil spills commonly involve three main steps: 1) automatic detection of dark spots in the processed SAR image, 2) feature extraction from the initially identified regions, and finally the 3) classification as oil slick or regions including look-alikes. In the first step, binary segmentation is usually applied to the input image representation in order to retrieve the depicted black spots. The second phase involves the extraction of statistical features from the aforementioned segmented areas that might include potential oil spills. In the last phase, the whole image and/or the segmented region is classifyied as oil spill or look-alike (binary classification).</p> <p>To help the classification, some authors propose a probabilistic approach to distinguish between oil spills and look alikes. Also, wind history information was also used to enhance the oil spill recognition system. Although the classification process is automated, an extensive pre-processing phase is required in order to initially extract geographic features. Multi-level segmentation schemes were also used to reduce the false positives rate. </p> <p>Several works proposed the use of neural networks for the feature extraction and classification of oil spills. Although performative, these approaches heavily rely on pre-computed features. To this end, genetic algorithms were used to identify the optimal subset of the extracted features and the optimal number of nodes in the network's hidden layer.</p> <p>Due to its capabilities in monitoring wide territories, SAR sensors can provide rich contextual information, about shores, vessels and oil platforms. This information can be useful for a more meaningful detection and alert system, while also help the distinction between oil spills and look-alikes, e.g., it is expected that a dark spot with linear formation close to a ship might correspond to an oil spill discharged from the vessel, rather than a look-alike. Moreover, information about nearby coastal territories or ships os important for an early warning system and a decision making module towards mitigating the overall danger. This represents a paradigm shift, where a different classification approach is required in order to identify properly multi-class instances enclosed in SAR imagery. Also, given the physical properties and events related to oil slicks, handcrafted features are not enough to represent the possible geometric shapes and volumetric sizes of oil spills affected by wind speed, sea currents, etc. Taking this into consideration, among with the existence of multi-class instances, semantic segmentation models could be deployed as robust alternatives to extract the rich informative content from SAR images. Even though several works explored this technique, they weren't able to fully leverage its capabilities efficiently, due to the lack of data, or simplistic approach, where only oil spill and look-alikes were classified. Only one study expanded this technique by also classifying land and ship instances.</p> <p>The use of custom-made datasets also made the comparison of techniques irrelevant. To this end, the authors present a new publicly available oil spill dataset, aiming to establish a benchmark dataset for the evaluation of future oil spill detection algorithms.</p>"},{"location":"science/probability/discrete-random-variables/","title":"Discrete Random Variables","text":""},{"location":"science/probability/discrete-random-variables/#random-variables","title":"Random Variables","text":"<p>In a nutshell, a random variable is a real-valued variable whose value is determined by an underlying random experiment.

Bancos de dados que portam decis\u00f5es racistas ao alimentar os sistemas algor\u00edtmicos de machine learning, como uma rede neural artificial, t\u00eam gerado padr\u00f5es racializados e modelos racistas para tratar novos dados. Assim, a chamada intelig\u00eancia artificial baseada em dados pode n\u00e3o apenas reproduzir, mas tamb\u00e9m ampliar, discrimina\u00e7\u00f5es que buscamos superar.</p> <p>O colonialismo dissemina que o \u00fanico modo de criar tecnologias \u00e9 esse que nos subordina e nos modula. Afinal, as plataformas digitais alegam buscar apenas e t\u00e3o somente a melhora de nossa experi\u00eancia. Para tal, extraem constantemente nossos dados a fim de realizar predi\u00e7\u00f5es, a ponto de n\u00e3o precisarmos mais querer, uma vez que os algoritmos que aprendem com os dados de comportamento poder\u00e3o predizer nossas vontades.</p> <p>Essa enorme cole\u00e7\u00e3o de dados reflete em milhares de datacenters, muitos com mais de 50 mil metros quadrados e milhares de servidores, gerando impacto ambiental e contrariando quem dizia que a digitaliza\u00e7\u00e3o melhoraria o meio ambiente.</p> <p>A localiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos data centers parece n\u00e3o esconder mais uma face do colonialismo digital: quase a metade deles est\u00e1 na Am\u00e9rica do Norte.

Os autores se inspiram na vis\u00e3o do psiquiatra e militante da resist\u00eancia argelina Frantz Fanon para organizar o pensamento, a estrat\u00e9gia e a a\u00e7\u00e3o da luta contra o colonialismo de dados. Isso implica, teoricamente, a perspectiva ambivalente da tecnologia. O digital pode ser colocado a servi\u00e7o da luta emancipat\u00f3ria? A IA pode ser reformatada e repensada para assegurar o interesse das classes populares, das comunidades tradicionais, ou est\u00e1 intrinsecamente vinculada \u00e0 efic\u00e1cia e \u00e0 efici\u00eancia exigidas pelo capital?

Typically, it is not the pixel intensities that are quantized directly. Rather, an alternative (latent) representation of the image is found, a vector in some other space $y$, and quantization takes place in this representation, yielding a discrete-valued vector $yhat$. Because it is discrete, it can be losslessly compressed using entropy coding methods, such as arithmetic coding, to create a bitstream which is sent over the channel. Entropy coding relies on a prior probability model of the quantized representation, which is known to both encoder and decoder (the entropy model).</p> <p>The smallest average code length an encoder-decoder pair can achieve, using a shared entropy model, is given by the Shannon cross entropy between the two distributions. </p> <p>Note that this entropy is minimized if the model distribution is identical to the marginal. This implies that a fully factorized entropy model with statistical dependencies will lead to suboptimal compression performance.</p> <p>One way conventional compression methods increase their compression performance is by transmitting side information: additional bits of information sent from the encoder to the decoder, which signal modifications to the entropy model intended to reduce the mismatch. In this scheme, the hope is that the amount of side information sent is smaller, on average, than the reduction of code length achieved by matching the entropy model more closely to the marginal for a particular image.</p> <p>For example, JPEG models images as independent fixed-size blocks of 8 x 8 pixels. However, some image structure, such as large homogeneous regions, can be more efficient represented by considering larger blocks at a time. For this reason, recent works such as HEVC dynamically adapt the size of those blocks. For HEVC to work, the decoder needs to decode the side information first, so that it can use the correct entropy model to decode the block representations. This can be efficient due to the ability to choose a partitioning that optimizes the entropy model for each image.</p> <p>But this is usually hand-designed. In contrast, the authors present a model that essentially learns a latent representation of the entropy model, in the same way that the underlying compression model learns a presentation of the image. This model is optimized by learning to balance the amount of side information with the expected improvement of the entropy model, by expressing the problem formally in terms of variational autoencoders (VAEs).</p> <p>They use this formalism to show that side information can be viewed as a prior on the parameters of the entropy model, making them hyperpriors of the latent representation.</p>"},{"location":"science/video-compression/kalman-net-artifact-reduction/","title":"Deep Non-Local Kalman Network for Video Compression Artifact Reduction","text":"<p>In this paper, the authors developed a framework that combines both model and learning methods in order to improve the quality of compressed frames.

These blocks are transformed and transmitted using variable length codes. We will refer to this kind of coding scheme as INTRA-frame coding, since the picture is coded without referring to other pictures in the video sequence.\"</p> <p>However, we can improve the compression by leveraging the previous frames of a video sequence and its inherent temporal redundancy. Most of the pixels from one frame to the other are in a static position, and by assuming this, techniques of INTER-frame coding have been proposed.</p> <p>A simple method of improving compression by coding only the changes in a video scene is called conditional replenishment (CR), and it was the only temporal redundancy reduction method used in the first digital video coding standard, ITU-T Rec. H.120. This method consists of sending signals to indicate which areas of a picture can just be repeated, and sending new code information to replace the changed areas. CR allows the choice of two methods for representing these areas: a SKIP mode, in which the area can just be replaced by previously decoded frames, and an INTRA mode, in which the area must be encoded due to changes in pixel values. But CR coding has a significant shortcoming, its inability to provide an approximation. The region is skipped if all pixels are the same, or the region is replaced by INTRA mode due to pixel changes.</p> <p>Adding a third type of prediction mode, in which a refining frame difference approximation can be sent, results in a further improvement of compression performance. This concept can be further improved by adding motion-compensated prediction (MCP). Most of the pixel changes in a frame is due to camera shifts or objects movements, and even the small movement can represent a significant shift of pixel values, especially on the edges of an object. So, by applying a small shift or displacing of a few pixels from the previous frame in to the next, we can further reduce the amount of information needed to perform frame difference approximation. </p> <p>This use of spatial displacement to form an approximation is known as motion compensation, and the encoder's search for the best spatial displacement approximation to use is known as motion estimation. The coding of the resulting difference signal for the refinement of the MCP signal is known as displaced frame difference (DFD) coding.</p> <p>Hence, the most successful class of video compression designs are called hybrid codecs. And its name is due to its construction as a hybrid of motion handling and picture coding techniques. Its design and operation involves the optimization of a number of decisions, including</p> <ol> <li>How to segment each picture into areas,</li> <li>Whether to replace each area of the picture with completely new INTRA-picture content,</li> <li>If not replacing an area with new INTRA content <ol> <li>How to do motion estimation, i.e, how to select the spatial shifting displacement to use for INTER-picture predictive coding (with a zero-valued displacement being an important special case). </li> <li>How to do DFD coding, i.e, how to select the approximation to use as a refinement of the INTER prediction (with a zero-valued approximation being an important special case), and</li> </ol> </li> <li>If replacing an area with new INTRA content, what approximation to send as the replacement content.</li> </ol> <p>And so, the authors introduce the main problem of their work, which is What part of the image should be coded using what method? Hybrid codecs employ several modes of operation that are adaptively assigned to parts of the encoded picture, and there is a dependency between the effects of the two motion estimation and DFD coding stages of INTER coding. The modes of operation are in general associated with signal dependent rate-distortion characteristics, and rate-distortion trade-offs are inherent in the design of each of these aspects.</p> <p>The optimization of these decisions in the design and operation of a video coder is the primary topic of this article.</p> <p>According to Wikipedia, Rate-distortion optimization (RDO) is a method of improving video quality in video compression. The name refers to the optimization of the amount of distortion (loss of video quality) against the amount of data required to encode the video, the rate. While it is primarily used by video encoders, rate-distortion optimization can be used to improve quality in any encoding situation (image, video, audio or otherwise) where decisions have to be made that affect both file size and quality simultaneously.</p>"},{"location":"science/video-compression/rlvc/","title":"Learning for Video Compression With Recurrent Auto-Encoder and Recurrent Probability Model","text":"<p>They explored the use of rnns for video compression. By using a wide range of video frames, they could explore temporal correlation in order to improve compression. A framework was designed and is built upon a Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE) and a Recurrent Probability Model (RPM).

This approach exploited both pixel and latent domains for compressing upcoming frames, and was called Recurrent Learned Video Compression (RLVC).</p> <p>Instead of loading frames on memory, the recurrent network is able to save the states of previous frames in memory and recurrently move forward, exploring a larger range of temporal correlation with less memory fingerprint.</p>"},{"location":"science/video-compression/rlvc/#framework","title":"Framework","text":"<p>First, the current frame and the previously compressed frame are compared in order to estimate temporal motion, by applying a pyramid optical flow network.
