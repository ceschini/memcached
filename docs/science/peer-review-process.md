# How to Make Decisions

For any decision you make, always document the reasons and logic that led to that decision, and if possible, how the paper can be improved in order to improve the decision.

**Strong Accept**: The paper has little or no flaws, and a clear contribution.

**Weak Accept**: The paper's merits outweight the flaws but only slightly.

**Borderline**: The paper has flaws and merits, and they are approximately of equal weight.

**Weak Reject**: The paper's flaws outweight the merits but only slightly.

**Strong Reject**: The paper has wrong or known results, or it is not evaluated correctly.
