## Submission Policies

**Paper formatting**: Papers are limited to eight pages, including figures and tables, in the WACV style. Additional pages containing only cited references are allowed. Please download the [WACV 2026 Author Kit](https://media.eventhosts.cc/Conferences/WACV2026/wacv-2026-author-kit-template.zip) for detailed formatting instructions.

Papers that are not properly anonymized, or do not use the template, or have more than eight pages (excluding references) will be rejected without review.

**Submission and review process:** WACV 2026 will be using OpenReview to manage submissions. Consistent with the review process for previous WACV conferences, submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned members of the program committee (area chairs and reviewers). The reviews and author responses will never be made public, and we will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process.

Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline.
