Ahmed et al.

The authors explored deep neural networks for race estimation using a newly available dataset called BUPT Equalised Face dataset, consisting of 1.3 M images labeled with one of four races: Caucasian, African, Asian or Indian. They evaluated on CFD and UTK datasets and used GRAD-CAM to get a visual explanation of the model.
