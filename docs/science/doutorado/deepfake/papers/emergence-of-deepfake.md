# The Emergence of Deepfake Technology: A Review

Deepfakes surfaced on the Internet in **2017**.

> Deepfakes are the product of artificial intelligence (AI) applications that merge, combine, replace, and superimpose images and video clips to create fake videos that appear authentic [1].

This study explored 84 news articles from 11 news companies' websites, indexed and organized to help analysis. The goal is to answer the following questions: **1) What are deepfakes, 2) who produces them, 3) what are the benefits and threats, 4) what are some current examples, and 5) how to combat them.**

## What are Deepfakes?

Hyper-realistic videos digitally manipulated to depict people saying and doing things that never actually happened. Deepfakes rely on neural networks that analyze large sets of data samples to learn to mimic a person's facial expressions, mannerisms, voice, and inflections. The process involves feeding footage of two people into a deep learning algorithm to train it to swap faces. In other words, **deepfakes use facial mapping technology and AI that swaps the face of a person on a video into the face of another person**.

As of this paper, Deepfakes were primarily developed using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This is a kind of deep learning architecture were two adversarial models go against each other, one of them trying to trick while the other tries to spot the fakes, while both learn and improve concurrently.

## Benefits of Deepfake Technology

Movie industry can use to improve low-quality footage, translate movies to foreign languages, adjust scenes without re-filming and enabling impaired actors to still perform and deliver. Ads can use this technology to spread awareness and campaigns to foreign countries using popular figures. **Video conference calls can translate speech and simultaneously alter facial and mouth movements to improve eye-contact and make everyone appear to be speaking the same language**.

It can also help transgender people to better see themselves as a preferred gender, or people with Alzheimer's interact with a younger face they may rememeber.

## Who produces Deepfakes?

There are at least four major types of deepfakes producers: 1) communities of deepfake hobbyists, 2) political players such as foreign governments, and various activists, 3) other malevolent actors such as fraudsters, and 4) legitimate actors, such as television companies.

These hobbyists are mainly focused on memes and porn. Political players and foreign governments may use deepfakes in disinformation campaigns to manipulate public opinion and undermine confidence in a given country's institutions, even rigging elections. Fraudsters may use it to conduct market and stock manipulation, and many other financial crimes. Criminals may also use it to impersonate an executive and steal information or money.

## The possible threats of Deepfakes

Deepfakes are a major threat to our society, political system, and business because they 1) put pressure on journalists struggling to filter real from fake news, 2) threaten national security by disseminating propaganda and interfering in elections, 3) hamper citizen trust towards information by authorities, and, 4) raise cybersecurity issues for people and organizations.

In the immediate aftermath of calamities or incidents the news media is running to grasp all the footage available, and deepfakes are dangerous to the understanding of the events. It can also be used to steer away the public view, misconcepting the events of skirmishes and war.

The intelligence community is concerned that deepfakes will be used to threaten national security by disseminating political propaganda and disrupting election campaigns.

> Putting words in someone's mouth on a video that goes viral is a powerful weapon in today's disinformation wars, as such altered videos can easily skew voter opinion.

> Nonetheless, the most damaging aspect of deepfakes may not be disinformation per se, but rather how constant contact with misinformation leads people to feel that much information, including video, simply cannot be trusted, thereby resulting in a phenomenon termed as "information apocalypse" or "reality apathy".

## Examples of Deepfakes

A lot of examples ranging from fake porn of actresses and memes of Nicolas Cage, to faked videos that resulted in coups and civic outrage. Propaganda ads using popular actors and public figures to spread their messages are also present.

## Methods to combat Deepfakes

The reviewed news articles suggest that there are four ways to combat deepfakes: 1) legislation and regulation, 2) corporate policies and voluntary action, 3) education and training, and 4) **anti-deepfake technology that includes deepfake detection, content authentication, and deepfake prevention**.

The most efficient ways to combat deepfakes from spreading therefore involve a mixture of legal, educational, and sociotechnical advances.
