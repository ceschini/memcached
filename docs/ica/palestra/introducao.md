## Classificadores de imagens

"Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules. The categorization law can be devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics. Two general methods of classification are ‘supervised’ and ‘unsupervised’."
