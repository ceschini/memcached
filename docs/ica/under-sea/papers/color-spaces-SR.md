# Analysis of Various Color Space Models on Effective Single Image Super Resolution

## First pass

The paper analyse the effect of different color spaces on the task of single image super-resolution. Based on they findings, yCbCr is the best one, but if I understood it correctly, the base model for the experiments already had this color space as default, so I don't know yet if it is a viable conclusion because of that.

## Second pass

The rest of the paper is basically a description of YCbCr and CMYK color spaces and the experiments made by them. The paper is well written but lacks theoretical background to hold its findings.
