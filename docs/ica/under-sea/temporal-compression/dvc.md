# DVC: An End-to-end Deep Video Compression Framework

The authors developed a fully end-to-end video compression based on neural networks. They employed a single loss function to train their models based on the trade-off between image quality and compression ratio. They mapped the traditional pipeline into deep learning functions, and following a plug-and-play approach, they invite the academic community to improve their framework. Reported results claim that this deep learning model achieves better compression ratings than that of H.264.
