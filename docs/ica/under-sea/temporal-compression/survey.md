# Survey on Temporal Compression

We will use the [three-pass approach](three-pass-approach) to filter some papers on the subject. This is intended to be a brief survey and not a fully systematic review.

## Three-pass approach survey pipeline

1. Academic search engine and well-chosen keywords to find three to five _recent_ papers in the area.
2. Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.
3. Find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography - These are the key papers and researchers in that area - Download the key papers and set them aside.
4. Go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they've published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences.
5. Go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings.
6. Scan it to identify recent high-quality related work.

These papers represent the first version of the survey.
