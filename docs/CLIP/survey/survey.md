- If so, how do they manifest?
- Where do they come from?
- How can we mitigate it?
- What VLMs are explored?
- What databases are used?

## Research Protocol

After establishing a viable search string for a specific database, the results will be collected, further filtered based on 1) title, 2) abstract, and finally, 3) three pass approach. After the collection and filtering of papers, a final filtering of duplicates will be performe
