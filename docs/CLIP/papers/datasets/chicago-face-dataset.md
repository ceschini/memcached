# The Chicago face database: A free stimulus set of faces and norming data

This dataset consist of 158 high-resolution, standardized photographs of Black and White male and females between the ages of 18 and 40 years. They were conducted with the goal of serving as stimuli for psychological phenomenas, such as theory of mind, emotion, stereotyping and prejudice, interpersonal attraction and more.

The photos were homemade by drafting volunteers at the school of business in chicago. They were black or white adults ranging from 18 to 40 years. Several pictures were taken using the same background and a standardized clothing, but with varying expressions performed by the subjects. Later on, 1087 raters made subjective ratings of the standardized neutral expressioned faces. Raters were first asked to estimate the age of the face, the race and gender, followed by the rating of traits such as threatening, masculine, feminine, baby-faced, attractive, trustworthy, happy, angry, sad, disgusted, surprised, fearful/afraid, and unusual (would stand out in a crowd).
