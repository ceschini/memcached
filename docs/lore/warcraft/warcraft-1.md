All has been peaceful for generations under the rule of King Wrynn III. The child sorcerer **Medhiv** is born of a coupling between the court Conjurer and a mysterious traveler. After the child is born, the woman disappears, and the baby is taken under the court cares.

#### 564

King Wrynn and Lady Varia have their first and only son, Prince Llane. The day of the birth is marked by a grand celebration, and the King gives one gold sovereign to all the people of the realm.

#### 571

Medhiv reaches his 12 birthday, and as such marks the Age of Ascension from childhood to adulthood, and is soon to be given the title as Apprentice Conjurer to the Court. However, on the eve of this occasion, the boy wakes up in the middle of the night by strange dreams of foul creatures chasing on scarred chasm. As soon as his father touches his fevered forehead, an outburst of magic starts to pour out of the young sorcerer, sending a wave of arcane energy as far as Northshire Abbey, where the clerics get all rounded up and make their way to the castle. It is required more than a hundred of them, together with the Conjurer to save Medhiv, that goes into a deep sleep and a state of comma. His father though, couldn't handle and drops dead, drained of all life energy.

The king and the clerics agree that the boy should be brought into the Abbey in order to rest and recover.
