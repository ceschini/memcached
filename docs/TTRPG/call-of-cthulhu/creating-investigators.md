# Creating Investigators

In *Call of Cthulhu*, each players takes the role of an investigator, someone whose mission is to unearth hidden secrets, discover forgotten places and, armed with knowledge which man was not meant to know, stand against the bloodcurdling horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos.

Working as a team, investigators can come from disparate backgrounds and be of varied occupations - each bringing certain expertise to the group. Together, joined in comradeship and common purpose, you will stand steadfast against the coming darkness.

- **Step One: Generate Characteristics**
