## Elementary Axioms & Aphorisms on Running & Playing Tabletop RPGs in the **Old School Style**

From Ben Milton (Maze Rats) & Steve Lumpkin (Roll 1d100)

## Introduction

This booklet is based on advices and notes taken from Milton's Maze Rats Rules-light RPG game, and Lumpkin's Roll 1d100 blog.

### What is Old School Style Play?

Based on Milton description:

> The more of the following a campaign has, the more old school it is: high lethality, an open world, a lack of pre-written plot, an emphasis on creative problem solving, an exploration-centered reward system (usually XP for treasure), a disregard for "encounter balance", and the use of random tables to generate world elements that surprise both players and referees. Also, a strong do-it-yourself attitude and a willingness to share your work and use the creativity of others in your game

### Using the principles

Take the principles as guiding remarks rather than stone-written rules. Adapt to your game and feel free to break them as you seem fit. Every group is unique. Use these rules to guide you when you feel lost.

**Your Table is Yours**

### Ruling over Rules

The primeval old school principle. Old school style games are often sparse in what situations their rules cover. There are often minimal, or no "skills" or "feats". *This is a feature, not a bug*. Let players take advantage of this openness and try crazy things (and apply logic to taste).

When you encounter a situation that the rules don't seem to cover, don't get distracted searching for it. Instead, make a common-sense ruling withing the spirit of the game and move on. **It doesn't have to be perfect**. Later, if there is a rule for it, tag it, and if not, make a note of the ruling and apply it consistently.

### Divest Yourself of Their Fate

As GM (or, more appropriately, the Referee), you are not an antagonist to the players or characters. Nor are you an author writing their story. Portray the world and embody its denizens genuinely, as they would react to characters' behaviors. Don't set out to tell a story, let one emerge from the characters' interactions with the world.

Be fair and impartial. Do not fudge rolls and avoid rolling in secret. This keeps the game honest and dangerous, and prevents any accusations of favoritism or railroading. It also encourages the players to manipulate and engage with the fictional world, rather than with the GM.

### Leave Preparation Flexible

Don't prepare a plot for the players to follow. During the game, observe how the players deal with a situation, and extrapolate the effects of their actions based on what you know. Don't plan the results too far ahead of time; players rarely do what you expect them to.

**Don't overdo the preparation!** Keep your situation ideas loose enough that they can be adapted to the PC's choices and the flow of the game. Remember that unused prep can always be recycled in later sessions.

### Build Responsive Situations

Establish situations with several actors or factions pursuing their own ends. Let the players' actions affect this environment, and let the consequences affect the players in turn. Show the situations worsening if the players don't address them.

One way to create interesting situations is to draw a grid that maps the relationships between the elements of a situation and how they relate and inretact, or how the party might intervene.

### Embrace Chaos...

Listen to that capricious muse, the dice. **Relying only on your own imagination can become exhausting and predictable, and can feel less like a concrete world to the players**. External inspiration and random results help you divest yourself of their fate.

**Use random tables to keep the game fresh.** The surprising twists that random tables add can bring an energy and mystery to the game that is hard to improvise.

### ...But Uphold Logic

*But don't use random results to the extent that the world feels nonsencial. If there is an obvious choice, consequence, or cause, use it*. This can help maintain verisimilitude and prevents the events to seem just random. It is ok to customize the random tables to make more sense to your settting.

### Let Them Off the Rails

Let them know where the main story is supposed to be, but if you expect them to zig, and they zag, go with it and improvise, *don't constrain or re-route them*. If you don't know what comes next, use random tables. Going with the crazy ideas of your players will let you join the fun and excitement of their chaos.
