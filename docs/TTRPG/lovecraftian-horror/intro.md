# Lovecraftian Horror RPGs

I'm looking into an RPG game with an OSR vibe. Call of Cthulhu is way too rules-heavy and does not harmonize with the rules-light fantasy OSRs I'm interested right now.

## Recommended Works

The following works are the heart of the Mythos and will make a good start:

- The Lurking Fear
- The Horror at Red Hook
- The Colour Out of Space
- The Dunwich Horror

- The Haunter of the Dark
- The Shunned House
