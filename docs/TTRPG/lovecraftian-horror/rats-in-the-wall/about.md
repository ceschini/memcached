# Rats in the Walls

## Intro

Rats in the Walls is an RPG where intrepid investigators face cosmic horrors in a desperate struggle to save mankind. The setting by default is the 20s and 30s. Though strongly inspired by Lovecraft, it does not directly use its gods and creatures, but it is rather easy to run games using the Mythos.

## Mechanics

Roll 2D6, add an attribute score, if the result is higher or equal to 8, the character gets what he wants and if it's less, he gets into trouble. Only the players roll the dice, the GM has better things to do.
