# Gameplay Rules

Here are some gameplay rules worth taking note.

## The D6  Decider

If there's a random chance for an outcome, such as whether a dropped torch goes out, the GM calls for a d6 roll. A 1-3 results in the worse outcome for the players, a 4-6 results in the better one.

## Luck Tokens

Sometimes the GM awards a **luck token** to a player for exceptional roleplaying, heroism or just plain coolness. Each player can only have one luck token at a time. They can give out to each other.

Player can cash in a luck  token to reroll any roll they just made. Must use the new result.

## Difficulty Class

The four standard DCs represent how difficult an action is.

- **Easy, DC 9.** Leaping a narrow chasm, sneaking up on an inattentive guard.
- **Normal, DC 12.** Kicking open a stuck door, picking a poor lock.
- **Hard, DC 15.** Swimming against a strong current, giving first aid to stop a character from dying.
- **Extreme, DC 18.** Climbing a slippery cliff one-handed, restraining a frenzied lion.

## Turn Order

### Initiative

Shadowdark RPG is played in turn order right from the start. At the beginning of the game, the GM establishes **initiative**, or the order in which the players act. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their DEX modifier. The GM adds the highest DEX modifier of any monster, if relevant.

The person who rolled the highest takes the first turn, and the turn order moves clockwise from that individual.

### Freeform Mode

Initiative need not be strict; some GMs keep only a loose round-robin, allowing the players to decide their turn order and actions before circling back to the GM's turn. Players might declare their actions as a group or act simultaneously, and the GM will need to adjudicate. A round passes once everyone has acted.

### Player Turn

1. The player counts down any personal timers for spells and other effects.
2. The player takes an action and may move up to near (split up in any way). The player can move near again if skipping an action.
3. The GM describes what happens as a result of the player's turn.

### GM Turn

1. The GM counts down any timers not tracked by players.
2. The GM checks for a random encounter, if needed.
3. The GM takes actions and makes movements for any relevant creatures or environmental effects.
4. The GM describes what the characters notice as a result of steps 1-3.

## Crawling

Characters are in **crawling rounds** while not in combat.

### The Shadowdark

The Shadowdark is any place where darkness,  danger, and myth reign supreme. It could be among the  crumbling ruins buried inside a  forgotten mountain stronghold.  It could be within the  spellwrought castle of an  undead sorcerer who probes the  universe for arcane secrets.  It could be beneath the  cursed trees where squirming  abominations boil out of a black  pit, pulping all in their path.

### Vision

All characters need light to see, but that's not true for the darkness-adapted beings of the Shadowdark.

Any area outside the characters' light sources is in total darkness.

### Light Sources

Most light sources last for up to an hour of real time and illuminate a limited area. New light sources lit while another is already active "ride along" on the current timer. There should only be one active light timer except in rare cases.

### Total Darkness

While in total darkness, a creature who is not darkness-adapted has disadvantage on most tasks it tries to undertake, as determined by the GM. Also, the environment becomes **deadly**. Check for a random encounter every crawling round.

### Movement

**Distances**. Distances are broken up into **close** (1.5 m), **near** (up to 9m), and **far** (within sight during an encounter or scene).

### Regroup

During crawling rounds, the GM can allow the players to **regroup**. PCs within reasonable reach of each other can come together into a marching order. They can also move as a group, taking a round each time. When needed, initiative shifts back to turns.

### Actions

While crawling, characters can take actions that might include:

- Prying a gem from a statue
- Sneaking up on a slumbering manticore
- Tapping on a suspicious wall to check for a hidden door
- Scanning a room for signs of hidden enemies
- Giving a rousing speech to a group of fearful townsfolk

## Resting

Injured or unconscious PCs can rest to recover from their wounds. To rest, a character must sleep for 8 hours and consume (or be fed) a ration. Sleep can be broken up for light and routine tasks, such as taking a turn on a watch.
