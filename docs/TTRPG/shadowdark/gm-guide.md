# Gamemaster Quickstart Guide

## Intro
### Game Mastering

Welcome, Game Master, and congratulations! You are the chosen one. You join a long and honored history of monumental gamers who have shaped countless imaginations. Their legacy is now yours.

As the Game Master, it is your job to lead the table in all things. There will be times when you must guide a shy player, when you must firmly call for focus during off-topic chatter, and when you must declare in a hushed whisper that all fate hangs on the single roll of a die.

### What to do

Describe what the characters newly perceive, and then let the players respond to that with actions. Call for checks when those actions require skill. Then start again from the top!

## Running the Game

### The Only Rule

The Only Rule is that you make the rules.

What's written in this book is a guide, not a constraint, and none of it takes precedence over your judgement. If something doesn't work at your table, change it or throw it out and don't look back.

### The Pact

The Pact is that you and your players are here to have fun, prop each other up and have fun. This is often unspoken and unseen, but it is always felt. It is based on goodwill, respect, and fellowship. Its enemies are selfishness, antagonism, and arrogance. Decisions made to defend the pact are always good ones.

### Settings DCs

The four standard DCs of **easy** (9), **normal** (12), **hard** (15), and **extreme** (18) are universal and help you quickly decide a DC. When determining the difficulty of a task, take the creature into account. When you ask players to make a check, state what kind of check it is. For example, an *easy Charisma check* or a *DC 15 Dexterity check*. That way, the players know what they need to roll to succeed.

### Challenge Variety

Each class excels at different tasks. So mix challenges of combat, social interaction and environmental hazards.

### Character Skill vs Player Skill

Encourage players' by giving them the opportunity to make decisions that rely on their creativity and wits rather than dice rolls or stats bonuses.

### Rules vs Rulings

As the GM, you have infinite power with only a handful of rules. Stat checks and the standard DCs can resolve any action. You need nothing more. Rather than pore through the book, adjudicate using what you already know. Make a ruling, roll the dice, and keep going!
