# Building a Heroic Narrative

The game takes place in a series of scenes with the heroes
as the main characters. An adventure is a collection of
scenes that make up a single story arc, and a campaign is a
collection of adventures that tell the entire epic tale of a
group of heroes. You can think of each adventure as a
movie in a saga of films, a book in a series of novels, or a
season of a television show. While many heroes have their
stories told over the course of a campaign, some wrap up
their careers in a single adventure that takes place in one
game session, called a one-shot. You can think of a one-
shot as a great stand-alone novella or movie.

This game is built so that each adventure you play and
each battle you fight gets more exciting as it goes on. In
fantastic tales, the heroes and their foes both grow in
power over the course of an adventure. But it isn’t time
alone that grows a hero’s capabilities. Rather, it’s the
adrenaline that comes from battle, the danger of the hero’s
profession, and the pressure to save the world that pushes
a character to do the impossible. Each small act of heroism
gives a hero the confidence and bravery to perform
legendary feats against all odds.

The things a hero can achieve at the end of the story are
far more daring and impactful than what they do at the
start, and the final showdown against a villain’s forces is
more deadly and desperate than the first. The rules of the
game help build a heroic narrative in this same fashion,
making use of the four most important mechanics for
building heroic narratives: Victories, Experience, Heroic
Resources, and Recoveries.

## Victories

Your hero’s power increases throughout an adventure as you fight more battles and overcome other challenges, measured through a stat called Victories. At the start of an adventure, your hero has 0 Victories.

### Victories after Combat

Each time your hero survives a combat encounter in which the party’s objectives are achieved, your Victories increase by 1. The Director can decide that a trivially easy encounter doesn’t increase a hero’s Victories.

### Victories after Noncombat Challenges

When your hero successfully overcomes a big challenge that doesn’t involve combat, the Director can award you 1 Victory. Such challenges can include things like a particularly complicated and deadly trap, a negotiation, a montage test, a complicated puzzle, or the execution of a clever idea that avoids a battle.

### Victories Reset

Whenever you finish a respite (see Respite), your Victories are converted into Experience.
