# A Prompt Array Keeps the Bias Away

The authors argue that beyond debiasing solutions, there is also a necessity for bias measurement. They explored different metrics for bias and proposed a framework of image-text contrastive loss with an array of learnable tokens prepended to text embedings in order to reduce bias without image degradations.
